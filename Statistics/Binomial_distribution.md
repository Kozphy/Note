## learn with first example

Let's say I have a coin, and it's a fair coin, and I'm going to flip it five times. The coin can be `heads` or `tail` which be indicated as `H` or `T` , separately.

$$
X = \text{number of heads after 5 flips}
$$

Question is what is probability that $X$ is equal to following?
$$
P(X = 0) = P(TTTTT) = (\frac{1}{2})^5 = \frac{1}{32} \\
P(X = 1) = P(HTTTT) \dotso P(TTTTH) = \frac{5}{32} \\
P(X = 5) = P(HHHHH) = \frac{1}{32} \\
P(X = 2) = P(HHTTT) \ or \ P(HTHTT) \dotso = \frac{5 *4}{2}* \frac{1}{32}
$$
