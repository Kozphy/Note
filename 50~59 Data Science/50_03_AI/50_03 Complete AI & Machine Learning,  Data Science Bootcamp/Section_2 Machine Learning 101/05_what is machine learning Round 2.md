How machine learning algorithms differ from normal algorithms is the learning aspect.

## Normal algorithm = set of instructions

Such as how to turn pile of raw ingredients into your favorite honey mustard chicken dish.

## Data analysis
It's looking at a set of data and gaining an understanding of it by comparing different examples, different features and making visualizations like graphs.

For ex, this might be looking at different samples of ingredients and comparing them.

What all the ingredients have in common are some of them missing something which have the most of a certain type of thing?

## Data science
it's running experiments on a set of data with hopes of finding actionable insights within it.

You can consider data analysis and machine learning as a part of data science.
