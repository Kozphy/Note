## What is machine learning
Machine learning is simply about predicting results based on incoming data and all these subcategories simply do that.

## Supervised learning
Think of it as CSV file have column name label.
In Supervised learning, The data that we received `already has categories`.
- classification
- regression
	- predict stock price
	- hire engineers based on inputs
## Unsupervised learning
Think of it as CSV file without perhaps the column names label.
Sometimes we have data that `doesn't have labels`, and this is called unsupervised learning.
- Clustering
	- We need to create these groups, or at least the machine to create these groups
- Association rule learning
	- we associate different things to predict what a customer perhaps might buy in the future when groups or labels doesn't exist.
	
## Reinforcement learning
Skill acquisition Real time learning.
It's all about teaching machines through trial and error, through rewards and punishment.

>These simply algorithms that are used with these subfields in order to come to these predictions.
