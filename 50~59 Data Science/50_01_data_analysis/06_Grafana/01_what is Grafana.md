- **Grafana** is a powerful **data visualization tool** that connects to various data sources, including Prometheus.
- Key Points:
    - **Visualization**: Grafana creates **rich dashboards** with modular panels. You can visualize metrics, logs, and traces.
    - **Alerting**: It provides an integrated alerting system for real-time notifications.
    - **Flexible Deployment**: Grafana can be hosted on-premises or via the managed Grafana Cloud service.
- **Grafana and Prometheus Together**:
    - Grafana connects to Prometheus to display real-time metrics visually. [While Prometheus actively collects and stores metric data, Grafana turns it into understandable, eye-catching graphics](https://stackshare.io/stackups/grafana-vs-prometheus)[2](https://stackshare.io/stackups/grafana-vs-prometheus)[3](https://cloudzy.com/blog/prometheus-vs-grafana/).
