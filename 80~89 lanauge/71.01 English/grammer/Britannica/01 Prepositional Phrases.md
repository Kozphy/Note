A [prepositional phrase](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/prepositional-phrase) is a group of words that begins with a [preposition](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/preposition) and ends with a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase (this noun, pronoun, or noun phrase is the [object](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/object) of the preposition).

Prepositional phrases [modify](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/modify) or describe [nouns](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/noun), [pronouns](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/pronoun), [adjectives](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/adjective), [adverbs](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/adverb), and [verbs](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/verb).
