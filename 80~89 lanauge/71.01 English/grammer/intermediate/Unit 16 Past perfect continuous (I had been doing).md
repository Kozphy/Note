###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A 
**had been -ing** is the past perfect continuous
### situation
Yesterday morning I got up and looked out of the window.
The sun was shining, but the ground was very wet.

It **had been raining**.

It was not raining when I looked out of the window.
The sun was shining. But it **had been raining** before.

You can say that something **had been happening** before something else happened:
- We'**d been playing** tennis for about half an hour when it **started** to rain heavily.

## Part B
Compare **have been -ing** (present perfect continuous) and **had been -ing** (past perfect continuous):
- Present perfect continuous
    - I hope the bus comes soon. I'**ve been waiting** for 20 minutes. (before now)
    - James **is** out of breath. He'**s been running**. (= he **has** been...)
- Past perfect continuous
    - At last the bus came. I'**d been waiting** for 20 minutes. (before the bus came)
    - James **was** out of breath. He'**d been running**. (= he **had** been...)

## Part C
Compare **was -ing** (past continuous) and **had been -ing**:
- It **wasn't raining** when we went out. The sun **was shining**. But it **had been raining**, so the ground was wet.
- Katherine **was lying** on the sofa. She was tired because she'**d been working** hard.

## Part D
Some verbs (for ex, **know**) are not normally used in continuous forms (**be + -ing**):
- We were good frends. We **had known** each other for years. (not had been knowing)
- A few years ago Lisa cut her hair really short. I was surprised because she'**d** always **had** long hair. (not she'd been having)
