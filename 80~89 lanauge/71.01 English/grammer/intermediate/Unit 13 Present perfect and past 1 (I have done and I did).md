# Unit 13 Present perfect and past 1 (I have done and I did)
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
### situation
He **has lost** his key.
This means that he doesn't have his key now.

Ten minutes later:
Now Tom **has found** his key. He has it now.
**Has** he **lost** his key? No, he **has found** it.
**Did** he **lose** his key? Yes, he **did**.

He **lost** his key. (past simple)
but now he **has found** it. (present perfect)

---
The present perfect (something **has happened**) is a persent tense. It tells us about the situation now.
'Tom **has lost** his key' = he doesn't have his key now.

The past simple (something **happened**) tells us only about the past. If somebody says 'Tom **lost** his key', we don't know whether he has the key now or not. We know only that he lost it at some time in the past.

## Part B
You can use the present perfect for new or recent happenings:
- I'**ve repaired** the washing machine. It's working OK now.

Usually, you can also use the past simple:
- I **repaired** the washing machine. It's working OK now.

Use the past simple (not the present perfect) for things that are not recent or new:
- Mozart **was** a composer. He **wrote** more than 600 pieces of music. (not has been ... has written)
- My mother **grew** up in Italy. 

## Part C
We use the present perfect to give new information (see Unit 7). But if we continue to talk about it, we normally use the past simple:
- A: Ow! I'**ve burnt** myself.
    - B: How **did** you **do** that? (not have you done)
    - A: I **picked** up a hot dish. (not have picked)
- A: Look! Somebody **has split** something on the sofa.
    - B: Well, it **wasn't** me. I **didn't do** it. (not hasn't been ... haven't done)
