# Unit 12 for and since, when...? and how long...?
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`
P.24
## Part A 
We use **for** and **since** to say how long something has been happening:
- We use **for** + a period of time
- We use **since** + the start of period

## Part B
We often leave out **for** (but not usually in negative sentences):
- They've been married **for ten years**. or They've been married **ten years**.

You can use **in** instead of **for** in negative sentences (**I haven't** ... etc.):
- They **haven't had** a holiday **in ten years**. (= **for** ten years)

We do not use **for + all**... (**all day** / **all my life** etc.):
- I've lived here **all my life**. (not for all my life)

## Part C 
Compare **when**...? (+ past simple) and **how long**...? (+ present perfect):
A: **When** did it start raining?
B: It started raining **an hour age / at 1 o'clock**.

A: **How long** has it been raining?
B: It's been raining **for an hour**/ **since 1 o'clock**.

## Part D
it's (= it is) a long time since something happened.
it's been (= it has been) six months (etc.) since something happened.
