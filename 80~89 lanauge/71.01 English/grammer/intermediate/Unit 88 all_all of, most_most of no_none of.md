# Unit 88 **all/all of**, **most/most of** **no/none of**
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
- all
- some
- any
- most
- much
- many
- (a) little
- (a) few
- no

You can use words above with a noun (**some food**/**few books** etc.)

We do not say "all of cars", "some of people" etc. (see Section B)

## Part B
- all
- half
- some
- any
- most
- much
- many
- (a) little
- (a) few
- none

You can use words above with **of** (**some of**/ **most of** etc.)

So you can say:
- some **of the people**, some **of those people** (but not some of people)
- most **of my time**, most **of the time** (but not most of time)

You don't need **of** after **all** or **half**.

Compare:
- **All flowers** are beautiful. (= all flowers in general)
    - **All (of) these flowers** are beautiful. (= a specific group of flowers)
- **Most problems** have a solution. (= most problems in general)
    - We were able to solve **most of the problems we had**. (= a specific group of problems)

## Part C
You can use **all of/ some of/ none of** etc. + **it/us/you/them**

We say: **all of us/ all of you/ half of it/ half of them** etc. You need **of** before **it/us/you/them**.

## Part D
We also use **some/most** etc. alone, without a noun.
