# Unit 11 how long have you (been)...?
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
We use the present perfect to talk about something that **began in the past and still continuous now**.

Compare the present and present perfect:
- Paul is in hospital.
    - He'**s been** in hospital **since Monday**. (= He **has** been ...)
    - We **know** each other very well.
    - We'**ve known** each other **for a long time**. (not We know)

## Part B
**I've known**/ **I've had** / **I've lived** etc. is the present perfect simple.
**I've been learning / I've been waiting** etc. is the present perfect continuous.

When we ask or say 'how long', the continuous is more usual:
- I'**ve been learning** English **since January**.
- it'**s been raining all morning**.

Some verbs are not normally used in the continuous:
- How long **have** you **known** Jane? (not have you been knowing)
- I'**ve had** these shoes for ages. (not I've been having)

## Part C
But we use the simple with always:
- I'**ve always lived** in the country. (not always been living)

## Part D
We say '**I haven't** (done something) **since/for**... (present perfect simple):
- I **haven't seen** Tom since Monday. (= Monday was the last time I saw him)
- Sarah **hasn't phoned** for ages. (= the last time she phoned was ages ago)
