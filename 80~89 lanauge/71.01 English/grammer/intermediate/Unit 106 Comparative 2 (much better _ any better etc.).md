###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## part **A much / a lot** etc. + comparative
Before comparatives you can use:
- much
- a lot
- far (= a lot)
- a little
- slightly (=a little)

## Part B **any / no** + comparative
You can use **any** and **no** + comparative (**any longer** / **no bigger** etc.)

## Part C **better and better**, **more and more** etc.
We repeat comparatives (**better and better** etc.) to say that something changes continuously

## Part D **the...the...**
You can say **the sooner the better, the more the better** etc.

We also use **the...the...** to say that one thing depends on another thing

## Part E older and elder
The comparative of **old** is **elder**

We use **elder** only when we talk about people in a family (**my elder sister, their elder son** etc.)
You can also use **older**

But we do not say that 'somebody is elder'
