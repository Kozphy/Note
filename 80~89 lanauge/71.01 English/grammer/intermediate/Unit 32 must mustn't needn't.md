# Unit 32 must mustn't needn't
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A must and mustn't
You **must** do something = it is necessary that you go it:
- Don't tell anybody what I said. You **must keep** it a secret.

You **mustn't** do something = don't do it:
- You **must** keep it a secret. You **mustn't** tell anyone. (= don't tell anyone)

## Part B needn't and don't need to
You **needn't** do something = it's not necessary to do it (but you can if you want):
- We have plently of time. We **needn't hurry**. (= it is not necessary to hurry)


You can also use **don't/doesn't need to**:
- We **don't need to** hurry.
Note that we say '**don't need to** do, but '**needn't do**' (without **to**).

Compare **needn't** and **mustn't**:
- You **needn't** tell Steve. I can tell him myself. (= it is not necessary)
- You **mustn't** tell Steve. I don't want him to know. (= don't tell him)

## Part C needn't have done
Compare **needn't** (do) and **needn't have** (done):
- Everything will be OK. You **needn't worry**. (it is not necessary)
- Everything was OK. You **needn't have worried**. (you worried, but it was not necessary)

## Part D needn't have (done) and didn't need to (do)
He **needn't have done** something = he did it, but now we know that it was not necessary:
- Why did he get up at 5 o'clock? He **needn't have got** up so early. He could have stayed in bed longer.

He **didn't need to do** something = it was not necessary to do it. It doesn't matter whether he did it or not
- He **didn't need to get** up early, so he didn't.
- He **didn't need to get** up early, but it was a beautiful morning, so he did.

You can also say 'He **didn't have to** get up' in these examples.
