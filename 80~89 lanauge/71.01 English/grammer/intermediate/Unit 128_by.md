But we say "do something **on purpose** (= you mean to do it):

- I didn't do it **on purpose**. It was an accident.

Note that we say **by chance**, **by accident** etc. (not by the chance / by an accident).
In these expresions we use **by** + noun without **the** or **a**.

We do not use **by** if we say **my car** / **the train** / **a taxi** etc. We say:
