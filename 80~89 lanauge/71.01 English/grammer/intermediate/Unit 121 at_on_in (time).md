## Part A
Compare **at, on** and **in**:
- They arrived **at 5 o'clock**.
- They arrived **on Friday**.
- They arrived **in June**. / They arrived **in 2012**

We use:
- **at** for the time of day
- **on** for days and dates
- **in** for longer periods (months/years/seasons etc.)

## Part B
- **at the moment / at the minute / at present / at this time** (= now):
- **at the same time**
- **at the weekends / at weekends** (or **on the weekend / on weekends** in American English)
- **at Christmas** (but **on Christmas Day**)
- **at night** (= during nights in general), **in the night** (= during a particular night)

## Part C
We say
- in the morning(s)
- in the afternoon(s)
- in the evening(s)
but
- on Firday morning(s)
- on Sunday afternoon(s)
- on Monday evening(s) etc.

## Part D
We do not use **at/on/in** before **last/next/this/every**:
- I'll see you **next Firday**. (not on next Friday)
- They got married **last June**.

We often leave out **on** before days, So you can say:
- I'l see you **on Friday**. or I'll see you **Friday**.
- I don't work **on Monday mornings**. or I don't work **Monday mornings**.

## Part E
We say that something will happen **in a few minutes / in six months** etc:

- Andy was gone away. He'll be back **in a week**.

We also use **in**... to say **how long it takes to do something**:
- I learnt to drive **in four weeks**. (= it took me four weeks to learn)
