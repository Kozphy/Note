###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A I was offered.../ we were given... etc.
Some verbs can have two objects. For ex, **give**:
- My grandfather gave **me this watch**.

It is possible to make two passive sentence:
- **I was given** this watch(by my grandfather). or **This watch was given** to me (by my grandfather)

## Part B I don't like being...
active: I don't like **people telling me** what to do.
passive: I don't like **being told** what to do.
- I remember **being taken** to the zoo when I was a child.(= I remember **somebody taking** me to the zoo)
- Steve hates **being kept** waiting. (= he hates **people keeping** him waiting)
- We climbed over the wall without **being seen**. (= without **anybody seeing** us)

## Part C I was born...
We say '**I was** burn...' (not I am born):
- I **was born** in Chicago.
- Where **were** you **born**? (not Where are you born?)

## Part D get
You can use **get** `for passive`:
- There was a fight, but nobody **got hurt**. (= nobody **was** hurt)
- I don't **get invited** to many parties. (= I'**m** not invited)
- I'm surprised Liz **didn't get offered** the job. (= Liz **wasn't offered** the job)

We use **get when things happen**. For ex, you cannot use **get** in these sentences:
- Jessica **is liked** by everybody. (not gets liked - this is not a 'happening')
- Peter was a mystery man. Very little **was known** about him. (not got known)

We use **get** mainly in informal spoken English.

We also use **get** in the following expressions (which are not passive in meaning):
- ger married, get divorced
- get lost (= not know where you are)
- get dressed (= put on you clothes)
- get changed (= change your clothes)
