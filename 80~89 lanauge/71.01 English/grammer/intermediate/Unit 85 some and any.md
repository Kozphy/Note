# Unit 85 **some** and **any**
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A 
In general we use **some** (also **somebody**/**someone**/**something**) in positive sentences and **any** (also **anybody** etc.) in negative sentences.

We use **any** in the following sentences because the meaning is negative:
- She went out **without any** money. (she **didn't** take **any** money with her)
- He **refused** to eat **anything**. (he **didn't** eat **anything**)
- It's a very easy exam. **Hardly anybody** fails. (= almost **nobody** fails)

## Part B
We use both **some** and **any** in questions. We use **some/somebody/something** to talk about a person or thing that we know exists, or we think exists.

We use **some** in questions when we ask for or offer things.
- Can I have **some** sugar, please? (there is probably some suger that I can have)

But in most questions, we use **any**. We do not know if the thing or person exists.

## Part C 
You can use **if + any**:
- Let me know **if** you need **anything**.

The following sentences have the idea of **if**:
- I'm sorry for **any** trouble I've caused. (= **if** I have caused **any** trouble)

## Part D
We also use **any** with the meaning 'it doesn't matter which'
- You can take **any** bus. They all go to the centre. (= it doesn't matter which bus you take)

We use **anybody/anyone/anything/anywhere** in the same way:
- We forgot to lock the door. **Anybody** could have come in.

Compare **some-** and **any-**:
- A: I'm hungry. I want **something** to eat.
    - B: What would you like?
    - A: I don't mind. **Anything**. (= it dones't matter what)
- B: Let's go out **somewhere**.
    - A: Where shall we go?
    - B: **Anywhere**. I just want to go out.
## Part E
**Somebody/someone/anybody/anyone** are singular words

But we use **they/them/their** after these words:
- **Someone** has forgotten **their** umbrella. (= his or her umbrella)
- If **anybody** wants to leave early, **they** can (= he or she can)
