### focal point
- `Single quotes` are for **Strings Literals** (date literals are also strings);
	- data literal = **appears directly in the source code**, like the `number 5`, the `character A`, and the text `â€œHello, Worldâ€` A value is an immutable, typed storage unit. A value can be assigned data when it is defined, but can never be reassigned.
- `Double quotes` are for Database **Identifiers**;
	- Identifiers =  such as tables, columns, views, indexes, synonyms, and stored procedure names
