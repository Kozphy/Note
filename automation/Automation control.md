# What is Automation control
It involves the use of technology, such as `computer systems` and `specialized software`, to manage and regulate the operation of machines, equipment, and processes in an automated manner. 

### Purpose
The main objectives of automation control are to improve efficiency, consistency, accuracy, and safety in various industrial and manufacturing applications. Here are some key components and concepts related to automation control:

### [Sensors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI49uFm5HRE)
Sensors are `devices that collect data from the physical environment or from machinery`. 

#### What can Sensor Do?
They can `measure parameters` such as temperature, pressure, speed, position, and more. Sensors play a crucial role in providing real-time information to the control system.

### [Control System](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/control-system#:~:text=A%20control%20system%20is%20a,big%20role%20in%20these%20systems.)
The control system is the `central component` of automation control. 

It `processes data from sensors` and `makes decisions based on predefined logic or algorithms`. 

This system can be a combination of hardware and software, including programmable logic controllers (`PLCs`), `microcontrollers`, or `industrial computers`.

#### There are two types of control systems commonly used: 
- `open-loop`: These control systems operate with `human input`. The control action is `independent of the output`.

- `closed-loop`: These systems can `be actively managed` or set to `operate autonomously`. They use feedback signals from the system to provide automatic control and maintain specific settings or a desired state `without human intervention`.

[Actuators explain](https://www.reac-group.com/en_en/facts/actuators/what-is-an-actuator/#:~:text=An%20actuator%20is%20a%20device,signals%20going%20into%20the%20system.)

Actuators are devices responsible for `carrying out the actions` or `commands generated by the control system`. 

They can be `motors, solenoids, valves, or other mechanical or electrical devices` that control the movement or operation of machinery and equipment.

### Human-Machine Interface (HMI)
HMIs are `user-friendly interfaces` that allow operators or engineers to interact with and monitor the automation system. 

They typically include `graphical displays, touchscreens, and control panels`.

### Control Logic
Control logic `refers to the set of rules`, algorithms, and decision-making processes programmed into the control system. 

It dictates how the system should respond to different inputs and conditions.

### Feedback Loop
Many automation systems incorporate a feedback loop, where the system continuously `compares the actual output or performance to the desired or reference values`. If there is a deviation, the control system makes adjustments to bring the system back to the desired state.

### PID Control
Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control is a widely used control method that adjusts control actions based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms. It is used to maintain desired setpoints or conditions.

### Communication Protocols
Automation systems often use communication protocols to exchange data between devices and components. Common protocols include `Ethernet, Modbus, Profibus, and others`.

### Safety Systems
Automation control often includes safety systems `to detect and respond to potentially hazardous situations`. 

These systems can shut down machinery or trigger safety measures to protect personnel and equipment.

### Data Logging and Analysis
Many automation systems include data logging capabilities to `record historical data`. This data can be analyzed to identify trends, optimize processes, and troubleshoot issues.



## The Benefit of Automation control
Automation control is applied in various industries, including manufacturing, energy, transportation, aerospace, and more. 

It plays a crucial role in improving productivity, reducing errors, increasing product quality, and enhancing safety in automated processes and systems.
