## Linear transformation(function)

A transformation is linear if it has **two properties**:

- all lines must remain lines, without getting curved.
- Origin must remain fixed in place.

### Play some transformation

We started off a certain liner combination of i-hat and j-hat and it ends up is that same linear combination of where those two vectors landed.

This means you can deduce where $\overrightarrow{v}$ must go based only on where $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$ each land.

For the transformation shown here ,we can read of that $\hat{i}$ lands on the coordinates (1,-2) and $\hat{j}$ lands on the x-axis over at the coordinates (3,0).

Adding that all together, you can deduce that it has to land on the vector (5,2).
