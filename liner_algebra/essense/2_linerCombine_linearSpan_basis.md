## base x, y coordinate vectors

- the one pointing to the right with length 1 which is commonly called "i-hat" or unit vector in x-direction.

- the one pointing to the straight up with length 1 which is commonly called "j-hat" or the unit vector in the y-direction

- $\hat{i}$ and  $\hat{j}$ are the "basis vectors" of the xy coordinate system

$$
\text{i-hat or unit vector of x-direction} = \hat{i} \newline
$$

$$
\text{j-hat or unit vector of y-direction} = \hat{j} \newline
$$

## liner combination

Any time you're scaling two vectors and adding them together which is called a linear combination of those two vectors.
