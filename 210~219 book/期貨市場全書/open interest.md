## Definition
`Open interest` represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts (such as options or futures) that have not yet been settled. Unlike trading volume, which tracks the total number of contracts traded, open interest focuses on the number of open positions in a particular contract. Essentially, it keeps tabs on how many contracts are still “open” and active.

1. **Significance**:
    - **Liquidity Indicator**: Open interest provides insights into the liquidity of a contract. Higher open interest suggests greater market interest and participation.
    - **Money Flow**: Increasing open interest indicates new money flowing into the market, while decreasing open interest suggests money exiting the market.
    - **Trend Strength**: Traders often use open interest as an indicator of trend strength.
2. **How It Changes**:
    - **Opening Positions**: When traders open new positions (buy or sell), open interest increases.
    - **Closing Positions**: If more contracts are closed out (either by offsetting positions or exercising options) than opened, open interest decreases.
    - **Scenario Example**: Imagine the open interest for an ABC call option is initially 0. A trader buys 10 ABC options contracts, increasing the open interest to 10. The next day, five contracts are closed, but 10 new contracts are opened. In this case, open interest increases by five to 15.
3. **Misconception**: While open interest reflects trader interest, it **cannot predict price movements**. [High or low open interest doesn’t directly forecast price action; it merely indicates market activity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openinterest.asp)[1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openinterest.asp).
