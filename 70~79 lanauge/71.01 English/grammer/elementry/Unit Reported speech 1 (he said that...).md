# Unit Reported speech 1 (he said that...)
###### tags: `English vacabulary in use elementry`

## Part A situation
You saw Paul yesterday and you want to tell somebody what he said.

There are two ways of doing this:
You can repeat Paul's words (direct speech):
Paul said, **I'm feeling ill**.

Or you can use reported speech:
Paul said **that he was feeling ill**.

Compare:
- Paul said, I am feeling ill.
- Paul said that **he was** feeling ill.

## Part B
When we reported speech, the main verb of the sentence is usually past (Paul **said** that.../ I **told** her that... etc.). The rest of the sentence is usually past too:
- Paul **said** that he **was feeling** ill.
- I **told** Lisa that I **didn't have** any money.

You can leave out **that**. So you can say:
- Paul **said that** he was feeling ill. or Paul **said** he was feeling ill.

In general, the present in direct changes to the past in reported speech

Compare direct and reported speech:
- You met Anna. Here are some of the things she said in direct speech:
    - I'**ve** lost my phone.

- Later you tell somebody what Anna said. You use reported speech.
    - Anna said that she **had** lost her phone.

## Part C
The past simple(**did/saw/knew** etc.) can stay the same in reported speech, or you can change it to the past perfect (**had done/ had seen / had known** etc.):
- direct
    - Paul said: I **woke** up feeling ill, so I **didn't go** to work.
- reported
    - Paul said (that) he **woke** up feeling, so he **didn't go** to work.
    - Paul said (that) he **had woken** up feeling ill, so he **hadn't gone** to work.
