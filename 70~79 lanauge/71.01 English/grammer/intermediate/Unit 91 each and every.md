## Part A 
**Each** and **every** are similar. Often it is possible to use **each** or **every**.

But **each** and **every** are not exactly the same.
- Each
    - We use **each** when we think of things separately, on by one.
    - **Each** is more usual for a small number.

- Every
    - We use **every** when we think of things as a group. The meaning is similar to **all**.
    - **Every** is more usual for a large number.

**Each** (but not **every**) can be used for two things
- In football, **each team** has eleven players. (not every team)

We use **every** (not **each**) to say how often something happens
