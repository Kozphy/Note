###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A **afraid to** (do) and **afraid of (do)ing**
I am **afraid to do** something =
I don't want to do it because it is dangerous or the result could be bad.
- This part of town is dangerous. People are **afraid to walk** here at night.

I am **afraid of** something **happening** =
I am afraid that something bad will happen.
- The path was icy, so we walked very carefully. We were **afraid of falling**. (= we were afraid that we would fall - not afraid to fall)

So you are **afraid to do something** because you are **afraid of something happening** as a result
- I was **afraid to go** near the dog because I was **afraid of being** bitten.

## Part B **interested in (do)ing** and **interested to** (do)

I'm **interested in doing** something = I'm thinking of doing it, I would like to do it:
- Let me know if you're **interested in **joining** the club.

I was **interested to hear/see/know** something = it was interesting for me.
- I was **interested to hear** that Tanya left her job.

This structure is the same as **surprised to... / glad to...** etc. (see Unit 65C):
- I was **surprised to hear** that Tanya left her job.

## Part C sorry for... and sorry to...
We use **sorry for** (doing) to apologise for something:
- I'm **sorry for shouting** at you yesterday. (not sorry to shout)

You can also say:
- I'm **sorry I shouted** at you yesterday.

We use **sorry to...** to say that we regret something that happens:
- I'm **sorry to hear** that Nicky lost her job.

We also say **I'm sorry to** to apologize at the time we do something
- I'm **sorry to bother** you, but I need to ask you a question.
