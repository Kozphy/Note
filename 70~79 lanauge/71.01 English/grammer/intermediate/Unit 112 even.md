# Unit 112 **even**
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
example:
Tina loves watching TV.

She has a television in every room of the house, **even the bathroom**.

We use **even** to say that **something is unusual or surprising**. It is not usual to have a television in the bathroom.

- These pictures are really awful. **Even I** take better pictures than these. (and I'm certainly not a good photographer)
- He always wears a coat, **even in hot weather**.

## Part B
You can use **even** with the verb in the middle of a sentence (see Unit 110):
- Laura has travelled all over the world. She's **even** been to the Antarctic.
- They are very rich. They **even** have their own private jet.

You can use **even** with a negative (**not even, can't even, don't even** etc.):
- I can't cook. I **can't even** boil an egg. (and boiling an egg is very easy)
- They weren't very friendly to us. They **didn't even** say hello.

## Part C
You can use **even** + comparative (**cheaper/ more expensive** etc.):
- I got up very early, but Jack got up **even earlier**.
- K knew I didn't have much money, but I have **even less** than I thought.

## Part D
**even though / even when / even if**
We use **even though / even when / even if** + subject + verb:
- **Even though Tina can't** drive, she has a car.
- He never shouts, **even when he's** angry.

We do not use **even** + subject + verb. We say:
- **Even though she can't** drive, she has a car. (not even she can't drive)
- I can't reach the shelf **even if I stand** on a chair. (not even I stand)

Compare **even if** and **even** (without **if**):
- It's dangerous to swim here **even if you're** a strong swimmer. (not even you are)
- The river is dangerous, **even for strong swimmers**.

Compare **even if** and **if**:
- We're going to the beach tomorrow. It doesn't matter what the weather is like. We're going **even if** the weather is bad.
- We want to go to the beach tomorrow, but we won't go **if** the weather is bad.
