# Unit 126 **to, at, in** and **into**
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
We say **go/come/travel (etc.) to** `place or event`. For ex:
**go to China**
**go to** work
**come to** my house
**go back to** Italy
**go to** the bank
**drive to** the airport
**return to** London
**go to** a party
**be taken to** hospital

- When are your friends **going back to Italy**? (not going back in Italy)
- Three people were injured in the accident and **taken to hospital**.

IN the same way we say **Welcome to**..., a **trip to**..., a **visit to**..., on **my way to**... etc:
- **Welcome to our country**! (not Welcome in)
- We had to cancel **our trip to Paris**.

Compare **to** (for movement) and **in/at** (for position):
- They are **going to** France. but They **live in** France.
- Can you **come to** the party? but I'll **see you at** the party.

We say "(I've) **been to**" a place or an event:
- I've **been to Italy** four times, but I've never **been to Rome**.
- Amanda has never **been to a football match** in her life.

## Part B
**get** and **arrive**

We say **get to** a place:
- They **got to the hotel** at midnight.
- What time did you **get to the party**?


We say **arrive in**... or **arrive at** ... (not arrive to).

We say **arrive in** a town or country:
- They **arrived in Madrid / in Spain** a week ago.

For other places (buildings etc.) or events, we say **arrive at**:
- What time did you **arrive at the hotel / at the airport/ at the party**?

## Part C home
We say: **go home, come home, get home, arrive home, on the way home** etc. (not preposition)

We do not say "to home":
- What time did you **get home**? (not get to home)
- I met Lisa **on my way home**.

## Part D into
**go into**, **get into** ...etc. = enter (a room / a building / a car etc.):
- I opened the door, **went into the room** and sat down.
- A bird **flew into the kitchen** through the window.

With some verbs (especially **go/get/put**) we often use **in** (instead of **into**):
- She **got in the car** and drove away. or She **got into** the car.
- I read the letter and **put it** back **in the envelope**.

The opposite of **into** is **out of**:
- She **got out of** the car and **went into** a shop.

For buses, trains and planes, we usually say **get on** and **get off**:
- She **got on the bus** and I never saw her again.
- You need to **get off** (the train) at the next station.
