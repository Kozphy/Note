# Unit 39 if I knew... I wish I knew
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A situation
Sarah wants to phone Paul, but she can't do this because she doesn't know his number.

**I'd phone** him **if** I **knew** his number. (I'd phone = I **would** phone)

Sarah doesn't know Paul's number, so she says 'if I **knew**.' She imagines what she **would** do **if** she **knew** his number.

When we imagine a situation like this, we use **if** + past (if I knew / if you were / if we didn't). **But the meaning is present, not past**
- There are many things I'd like to do **if** I **had** more time. (bit I don't have time)

## Part B
We use the past in the same way after **wish** (I **wish** I **knew** / I **wish** you **were** etc.)
We use **wish** to say that we regret something, that something is not as we would like it to be:
- I **wish** I **knew** Paul's phone number. (= I don't know it and I regret this)
- Do you ever **wish** you **could** fly? (you can't fly)

## Part E
**Could** sometimes means 'would be able to' and sometimes 'was/were able to'
- She **could get** a better job if she **could speak** another language.
- I wish I **could** help you.
