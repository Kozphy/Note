# Unit 118 like / as if
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
We use **like** or **as if** to say **how somebody/something looks, sounds or feels**:
- That house **looks like** it's going to fall down. or That house **looks as if** it's going to fall down.
- Amy **sounded like** she had a cold, didn't she? or Amy **sounded as if** she had a cold, didn't she?


You can also use **as though** in these examples:
- I don't **feel as though** I've had a holiday.

Compare:
- You **look tired**. (**look** + adj)
- You **look like you haven't slept**. You **look as if you haven't slept.** (**look like / as if** + subject + verb)

## Part B
We say:
**it looks like**... or **it looks as if**...
**it sounds like**... or **it sounds as if**...

- Sarah is very late. **it looks like** she isn't coming. or **it looks as if** she isn't coming.
- **It looked like** it was going to rain, so we took an umbrella. or **It looked as if** it was going to rain...

You can also use **as though**:
- **It sounds as though** they're having a party.

## Part C
You can use **like / as if / as though** with `other verbs to say how somebody does something`.
- He ran **like he was running for his life**.
- After the interruption, the speaker went on talking **as if nothing had happened**.

## Part D
After **as if**, we sometimes __use the *past* when we are talking about the *present*__.
For ex:
- I don't like him. He talks **as if** he **knew** everything.

The meaning is not past. We use the past (as if he **knew**) because the idea is not real: he does *not* know everything. We use the past in the same way with **if** and **wish** (see Unit 39).
We do not normally use **like** in this way.

Some more examples:
- She's always asking me to do things for her - **as if I didn't** have enough to do already. (I have enough to do already)
- Joe's only 40. Why do you talk about him **as if he was** an old man? (he isn't an old man).

When you use the past in this way, you can use **were** instead of **was**:
- Why do you talk about him **as if he were** an old man?
- They treat me **as if I were** their own son. or ...**as if I was** their own son. (I'm not their son).
