# Unit 81 -'s (**your sister's** name) and **of**... (the name **of the book**)

###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A 's

We use **-'s** (apostrophe + **s**) mostly `for people or animals`:

- **Tom's** computer isn't working. (not the computer of Tom)

We do not use **-'s** after a long group of words. So we say:

- **my friends's** mother

but  
the mother **of the man we met yesterday**. (not the man we met yesterday's mother)

Note that we say **a woman's hat** (= a hat for a woman), **a boy's name** (= a name for a boy), **a bird's egg** (= an egg laid by a bird) etc.

## Part B 's and s'

With a singular noun we use **'-s**

With a plural noun (sisters, friends etc.) we put an apostrophe (') after **s**:

- **my sisters'** room (= **their** room - two or more sisters)

if a plural noun does not end in **-s** (for ex **men/women/children/people**) we use **'s**:

- the **men's** changing room

You can use **'s** after more than one noun:

- **Jack and Karen's** children

## Part C of

`For things, ideas` etc, we normally use **of**:

- the temperature **of the water** (not the water's temperature)
- the name **of the book**

We say **the beginning/end/middle of.../ the top/ bottom of..../the front/ back/side of...**:

- **the beginning of** the month (not the month's beginning)

## Part D 's or of... for an organisation (= a group of people)

- **the government's** decision or the decision **of the government**
- **the company's** usccess or the success **of the company**

We also use **'s** for places.

- **the city's** streets
- **the world's** population
- **Italy's** prime minister

## Part E 's with time words

We use **'s** with time words (**yesterday / next week** etc):

- Do you still have **yesterday's** newspaper?
- **Next week's** meeting has been cancelled.

We also use **'s** (or **s'** with plural words) with perioids of time:

- I've got **a week's holiday** starting on Monday.
