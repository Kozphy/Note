# Unit 80 Noun + noun (a bus driver / a headache)
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A You can use two nouns together to mean one thing/ person/ idea etc.
The first noun is like an adj. It tells us what kind of thing/person/idea etc.
- a **bus driver** = the driver of a bus
- **income tax** = tax that you pay on your income
- a **Paris hotel** = a hotle in Paris
- my **life story** = the story of my life

Sometimes the first word ends in **-ing**:
- a **frying** pan (= a pan for frying)
- a **washing** machine

## Part B Sometimes there are more than two nouns together
- I waited at the **hotel reception desk**.
- We watched the **World Swimming Championships** on TV.
- If you want to play table tennis (= a game), you need **a table tennis table (= a table).

## Part D Note the difference between
a **coffee cup** (maybe empty) and a **cup of coffee** (= a cup with coffee in it)
a **shopping bag** (maybe empty) and a **bag of shopping** (= a bag full of shopping)

## Part E When we use noun + noun, the first noun is like an obj. It is normally singular, but the meaning is often plural

For ex: a **car park** is a place to park **cars**, an **apple tree** is a tree that has **apples**.

In the same way:
a **three-hour** journey (= a journey that take three **hours**)
a **ten-pound** note (= a note with the value of ten **pounds**)

Compare:
- It was **a four-week** course. (not a four weeks course)
but The course lasted four **weeks**.
