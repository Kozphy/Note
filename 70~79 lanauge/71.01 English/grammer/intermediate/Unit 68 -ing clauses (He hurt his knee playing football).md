###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A  -ing clause
Kate is in the kitchen. She's making coffee. You can say:
- Kate is in the kitchen making coffee.

You can use **-ing** in this way when two things happen at the same time:
- A man ran out of the house **shouting**. (he ran out of the house and he was shouting)
- Be careful **crossing the road**

We also use **-ing** when one action happends during another action:
- Joe hurt his knee **playing football**. (= while he was playing)

You can also say '**while doing** something' and '**when doing** something':
- Joe hurt his knee **while playing** football.
- Be careful **when crossing** the road.

## Part B having (done)
When one action happeens before something else, we use **having (done)** for the first action:
- **Having found** a hotel, we looked for somewhere to eat.
- **Having finished** her work, she went home.

You can also say **after -ing**:
- **After finishing** her work, she went home.

These structures are used more in written English than in spoken English.
When we begin a sentence with '**Having** (done something)' or '**After** (doing something)', we write comma(,) after this part of the sentence:
- **Having finished her work**, she went home.

## Part C -ing ...
You can also use **-ing** to explain something, or to say why somebody does something.

The sentence usually begins with **-ing**:
- **Feeling tired**, I went to bed early. (= because I felt tired)
- **Being** unemployed, he doesn't have much money. (= because he is unemployed)

We use **having (done)** for something that is complete before something else:
- **Having seen** the film twice, I didn't want to see it again. (= because I had seen it twice)

These structures are used more in written English than in spoken English.
When we begin a sentence with **-ing (Feeling tired... / Not knowing.../ Having seen...** etc.), we write a comma (,) after this part of the sentence.
- **Not knowing what to do**, I called my friend to ask her advice.
