# Unit 26 can, could, and (be) able to
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A 
We use **can** to say that something is possible or allowed, or that somebody has the ability to do something. We use **can + infinitive (can do / can see etc.)**

## Part B
You can say that somebody **is able to** do something, but **can** is more usual.

But **can** has only two forms: **can** (present) and **could** (past). So sometimes it is necessary to use **(be) able to**. Compare
- can
    - I **can't** sleep.
    - Tom **can** come tomorrow.
    - Maria **can** speak French, Spanish and English.
- be able to
    - I **haven't been able to** sleep recently.
    - Tom **might be able to** come tomorrow.
    - Applicants for the job **must be able to** speak two foreign languages.

## Part C
We also use **could** to say that somebody had the ability to do something, or was allowed to do something

## Part D could and was able to
We use **could** for general ability

But to say that somebody succeeded in doing something in a specific situation, we normally use **was/were able to** or **managed to** (not **could**)

## Part C
We do not normally use **would** in the **if-part** of the sentence:
- I'd be very scared **if** somebody **pointed** a gun at me. (not if somebody would point)
- **If** we **went** by bus, it would be cheaper. (not if we would go)

**Could** and **might** are also possible:
- if I won a lot of money, I **might** buy a house. (= it is possible that I would buy a house)
- If it stopped raining, we **could go** out. (= we would be able to go out)
