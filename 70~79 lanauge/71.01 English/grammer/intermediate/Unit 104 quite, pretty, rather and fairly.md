# Unit 104 **quite, pretty, rather** and **fairly**
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
**Quite** and **pretty** are similar in meaning (= less than 'very', but more than 'a little')
**Pretty** is an informal word and is used mainly in spoken English.

**Quite** goes before **a/an**:
- We live in **quite and old house**. (not a quite old house)

Compare:
- Sharah has **quite a** good job.
- Sarah has **a pretty** good job.

You can also use **quite** (bot not **pretty**) in the following ways:
**quite a/an** + noun (without and adjective):
- I didn't expect to see them. It was **quite a surprise**. (= quite a big surprise)

**quite a lot (of...)**:
- There were **quite a lot of** guests at the wedding.

**quite** + verb, especially **like** and **enjoy**:
- I **quite like** tennis, but it's not my favourite sport.

## Part B
**Rather** is similar to **quite** and **pretty**. We often use **rather** for negative ideas (things we think are not good):
- The weather isn't good. It's **rather cloudy**.
- Paul is **rather shy**. He doesn't talk very much.

**Quite** is also possible in these examples.

When we use **rather** for positive ideas (**good/nice** etc.). it means 'unusually' or 'surprisingly'.
- These oranges are **rather good**. Where did you get them?

## Part C
**Fairly** is weaker than **quite/rather/pretty**. For ex, if something is **fairly good**, it is not very good and it could be better:
- My room is **fairly big**, but I'd prefer a bigger one.
- We see each other **fairly often**, but not as often as we used to.

## Part D
**Quite** also means 'completly'. For ex:
- Are you sure? You, **quite sure**. (= completely sure)

**Quite** means 'completely' with a number of adj, especially:
- sure
- right
- true
- clear
- different
- incredible
- amazing
- certain
- wrong
- safe
- obvious
- unnecessary
- extraordinary
- impossible

We also use **quite** (= completely) with some verbs. For ex
- I **quite agree** with you. (= I completely agree)

**not quite** = not completely:
- **I don't quite understand** what you mean.

Compare the two meanings of **quite**:
- The story is **quite interesting**. (= less than 'very interesting')
- The story is **quite true**. (= completely true)
