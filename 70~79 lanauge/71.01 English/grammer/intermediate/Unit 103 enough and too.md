# Unit 103 **enough** and **too**
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A 
**Enough** goes after `adj` and `adv`:
- I can't run very far. I'm not **fit enough**. (not enough fit)

**Enough** normally goes before nouns:
- We have **enough money**. We don't need any more.

We also use **enough** alone (without a noun or adj)
- We don't need more money. We have **enough**.

## Part B
**too** and **enough**

Compare **too**... and **not...enough**:
- You never stop working. you work **to hard**. (= more than is necessary)
- You're lazy. You **don't** work **hard enough**. (= less than is necessary)

Compare **too much/many** and **enough**:
- There's **too much furniture** in the room. There's not **enough space**.
- There were **too many people** and not **enough charis**.

## Part C
**enough/too + for**... and **to**...

We say **enough/too...for** somebody/something
- Does Joe have enough experience **for the job**?

We say **enough/too...to** do something. for ex:
- Does Joe have enough experience **to do** the job?

The next example has both **for**... and **to**...:
- The bridge is just wide enough **for two cars to pass** one another.

## Part D
**too hot to eat** etc.
We say:
- The food was very hot. We couldn't eat **it**.
- The food was so hat that we couldn't eat **it**.
- The food was **to hat to eat**. (not to eat it)

In the same way we say:

- This chair isn't **strong enough to stand on**. (not to stand on it)
