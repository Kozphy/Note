###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A 
There are two types of relative clause. In following, the relative clauses are **underlined**.

In Type 1, the relative clauses tell you which person or thing (or what kind of person or thing) the speaker means
- Type 1
    - The woman <ins>who lives next door to me is a doctor</ins>.
    - Grace works for a company <ins>that makes furniture</ins>.
    - We stayed at the hotel <ins>(that) you recommended</ins>.
> We do not use commas (,) with these clauses

In Type 2, the relative clauses do not tell you which person or thing the speaker means. **We already know which thing or person is meant**: 'My brother Ben', 'Anna's new job' and 'the Park Hotel.'
- Type 2
    - My brother Ben, <ins>who lives in Hong Kong</ins>, is an architect.
    - Anna told me about her new job, <ins>which she's enjoying a lot</ins>.
    - We stayed at the Park Hotel, <ins>which a friend of ours recommeneded</ins>.


## Part B
In both types of relative clause we use **who** for people and **which** for things. But
- Type 1
    - You can use **that**
        - Do you know anyone **who/that** speaks French and Italian?
        - Grace works for a company **which/that** makes furniture.
    - You can leave out **who/which/that** when it is the object. (see Unit 93)

    - We do not often use **whom** in this type of clause (see Unit 94B).

        - John, **who** speaks French and Italian, works as a tour guide. (not that speaks)
        - Anna told me about her new job, **which** she's enjoying a lot.

    - You can use **whom** for people (when it is the object).
