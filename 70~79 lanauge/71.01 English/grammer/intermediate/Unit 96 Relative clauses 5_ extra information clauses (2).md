# Unit 96 Relative clauses 5: extra information clauses (2)
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
preposition + **whom/which**

You can use a preposition + **whom** (for people) and **which** (for things)

So you can say:
- to whom
- with whom
- about whom
- of which
- without which
- from which

Mr Lee, **to whom I spoke** at the meeting, is interested in our proposal.

In spoken English we often `keep the preposition after the verb in the relative clause`:
- Katherine told me she works for a company called 'Latoma', **which** I'd never **heard of** before.

We do not use **whom** when the preposition is in this position:
- Mr Lee, **who I spoke to** at the meeting, is interested in our proposal.

For prepositions in relative clauses, see also Unit 93C.

## Part B
**all of/ most of** etc. + **whom/which**

You can say:
- Helen has three brothers, **all of whom** are married.
- They asked me a lot of question, **most of which** I couldn't answer.

In the same way you can say:
- many of whom
- some of whom
- neither of whom
- none of which
- both of which
- one of which

You can also say:
- the cause of which
- the name of which

## Part C 
**which** (not what)
- Joe get the job. This surprised everybody. (2 sentences)
- Joe got the job, which surprised. (1 sentence)

Ine this example, **which** = "the fact that Joe got the job". We use **which** (not what) in sentences like these:
- Sarah couldn't meet us, **which** was a shame. (not what was a shame)

For **what** and **that**, see Units 92D and 93D.
