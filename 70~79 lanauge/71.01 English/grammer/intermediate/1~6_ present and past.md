## unit 4 Present continous and present simple 2
### We use continuous forms for actions and happenings that have started but not finished (they are eating/ it is raining etc.). Some verbs(for example, know and like) are not normally used in this way. We don't say "I'am knowing" or "they are liking"; we say "I know", "they like".

When think means "consider", the continuous is possible
