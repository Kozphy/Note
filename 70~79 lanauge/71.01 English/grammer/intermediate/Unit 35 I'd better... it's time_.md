# Unit 35 I'd better... it's time...
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A had better (I'd better / you better etc.)
**I'd better do** something = it is advisable to do it. if I don't do it, there will be a problem or a danger:
- I have to meet Amy in ten minutes. **I'd better go** now or I'll be late.
- **We'd better stop** for petrol soon. The tank is almost empty.

The negative is **I'd better not** (= I **had** better not)

**Had** is normally past, but we use **had better** for the present or future, not past.
- I'd better go **now / tomorrow**.

We say I'd better **do** (not to do)
- It might rain. We'd better **take** an umbrella. (not We'd better to take)

## Part B
**Had better** is similar to **should** but not exactly the same. We use **had better** only for a specific situation, not for things in general. YOu can use **should** in all types of situations to give an opinion or give advice.

Also, with **had better**, there is always a danger or a problem if you don't follow the advice.
**Should** means only 'it is a good thing to do'

## Part C It's time
You can say **it's time** (for somebody) **to**...:
- It's time **to go** home. / It's time for us **to go** home.

When we use **it's time + past** (it's time we **went** etc.), the meaning is present, not past:
- **It's time** they **were** here. Why are they so late? (not it's time they are here)

**It's time** somebody **did** something = they should have already done it or started it.
We often use this structure to criticise or to complain:
- He's very selfish. **It's time he realised** that he isn't the most important person in the world.

You can also say **It's about time...**:
- Jack is a great talker, but **it's about time** he **did** something instead of just talking.
