# Unit 93 Relative clauses 2: clauses with and without **who/that/which**
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
Look at these example sentences from Unit 92:
- **The woman who lives** next door to me is a doctor. (or The woman **that** lives...)
- Where are **the keys that were** on the table? (or ...the keys **which** were...)

You must use **who/that/which** when it is the subject of the relative clause. You cannot leave out **who/that/which** in these examples.

## Part B
Sometimes **who/that/which** is the **object** of the verb.
- **The woman who I wanted to see** was away on holiday.
- Did you find **the keys that you lost**?

When **who/that/which** is the `object, you can leave it out`. So you can say:
- **The woman I wanted to see** was away. or The woman **who** I wanted to see.

Note that we say:
**the keys you lost** (not the keys you lost them)
**the dress Lisa bought** (not the dress Lisa bought it)

## Part C
Note the position of prepositions (**to/in/for** etc.) in relative clauses:
- Tom is talking to a woman. Do you know her?
    - Do you know the woman Tom is **talking to**? (or ...the woman **who/that** Tom is talking to)
- I slept in a bed. It wasn't comfortable.
    - The bed I **slept in** wasn't comfortable.  (or The bed **that/which** I slept in...)

Note that we say:
- the books **you were looking for** (not the books you were looking for them)
- the man **I was sitting next to** (not the man I was sitting next to him)

## Part D
- **Everything** (that) **they said** was true. (not Everything what they said)
- I gave her **all the money** (that) **I had**. (not all the money what I had)

**What** = the thing(s) that:
- **What they said** was true. (= The things that they said)
