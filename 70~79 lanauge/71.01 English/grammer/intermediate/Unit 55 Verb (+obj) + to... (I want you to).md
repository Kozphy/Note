## Part C make, let (without to)
We say **make** somebody **do** something, **let** somebody **do** something (without **to**):
- I **made him promise** that he wouldn't tell anybody what happened. (not made him to promise)
- Hot weather **makes me feel** tired. (= causes me to feel tired)

We say **make** somebody **do**, but in the passive we say (be) **made to** do (with **to**):
- **We were made to wait** for two hours. (= They **made us wait**...)
