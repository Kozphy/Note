# Unit 48 Reported speech 2
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
We do not always change the verb in reported speech. If the situation is still the same, It is not necessary to change the verb to the past:
- direct
    - Paul said, '**My** new job **is** boring'
- reported
    - Paul said that **his** new job **is** boring.

But if the situation has changed or finished you need to use a past verb. Compare:
- Paul left the room suddenly. He said '**I have to go**.' (direct speech)
- Paul left the room suddenly. He said (that) **he had to go**. (not has to go)


## Part B
You need to use the past in reported speech when what was said is different from what is really true. for ex:

You met Rachel a few days ago. She said:
- Have you heard? **Joe is hospital**.

Later that day you meet Joe in the street. You say:
- Joe, this is a surprise. Rachel said you **were** in hospital. (not you are in hospital - It's clear that he isn't)

## Part C
If you say who somebody is talking to, use **tell**:
- Rachel **told me** that you were in hospital. (not Rachel said me)

Otherwise use **say**:
- Rachel **said** that you were in hospital. (not Rachel told that...)

You can '**say** something **to** somebody':
- Anna **said** goodbye **to** me and left. (not Anna said me goodbye)


## Part D
We say '**tell** somebody **to**...' and '**ask** somebody **to**...'

Compare direct and reported speech:
- direct
    - **Drink** plenty of water, the doctor said to me.
    - **Don't work** too hard, I said to Joe.
- reported
    - The doctor **told me to drink** plenty of water.
    - I **told Joe not to work** too hard.

You can also say 'Somebody **said (not) to** do something':
- Paul **said not to worry** about him. (but not Paul said me)
