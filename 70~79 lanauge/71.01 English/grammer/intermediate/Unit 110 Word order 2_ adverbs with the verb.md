# Unit 110 Word order 2: adverbs with the verb

## Part A
Some adverbs (for ex, **always, also, probably**) go with the verb in the middle of a sentence.
- Emily **always drives** to work.
- We were feeling very tired and we **were also** hungry.
- The meeting **will probably be cancelled**.

## Part B
if the verb is one word (**drives/cooked** etc.), the adverb goes before the verb:


|       | adverb     | verb       |          |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Emily | **always** | **drives** | to work. |
| I      | **almost**,           | **fell**           | as I was going down the stairs.          |
- I cleaned the house and **also cooked** the dinner. (not cooked also)
- Laura **hardly ever watches** television and **rarely reads** newspapers.


Note that these adverbs (**always/usually/also** etc.) go before **have to**...:
- Joe never phones me. I **always have to** phone him. (not I have always to phone)

But adverbs go after **am/is/are/was/were**:
- We were feeling very tired and we **were also** hungry. (not also were)
- You'**re always** late. You**re never** on time.
- The traffic **isn't usually** as bad as it was this morning.

## Part C
`If the verb is two or more words` (for ex, **can remember/will be cancelled**), the **adverb usually goes after the first verb** (**can/doesn't/will** etc.)

|       | verb1       | adverb         | verb2        |                 |
| ----- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| I     | **can**     | **never**      | **remember** | her name.       |
| Clare | **doesn't** | **usually**    | **drive**    | to work.        |
|       | **Are** you | **definitely** | **going**    | away next week? |
|  The meeting     | **will**            | **probably**               | **be**             | cancelled.                |
- You'**ve always been** very kind to me.
- Jack can't cook. He **can't even boil** an egg.
- The house **was only built** a year ago and it'**s already falling** down.

Note that **probably** goes before a negative (**isn't/won't** etc.). So we say:
- I **probably won't see** you. or
- I'll **probably not** see you. (but not I won't probably)

## Part D
We also use **all** and **both** with the verb in the middle of a sentence:
- We **all felt** ill after the meal. (not felt all ill)
- My parents **are both** teachers.
- Sarah and Jane **have both applied** for the job.
- My firends **are all going** out tonight.

## Part E
Sometimes we use **is/will/did** etc. instead of repeating part of a sentence (see Unit 51):
- Tom says he isn't clever, but I think he **is**. (= he **is clever**)

When we do this, we put **always/never** etc. before the verb:
- He always says he won't be late, but he **always is**. (= he **is always** late)
- I've never done it and I **never will**. (= I **will never** do it)
