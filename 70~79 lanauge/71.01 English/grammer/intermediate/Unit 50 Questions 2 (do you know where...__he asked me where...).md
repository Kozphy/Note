# Unit 50 Questions 2 (do you know where...?/he asked me where...)
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

# Part A
Do you **know where**...?/ **I don't know why**.../**Could you tell me what**...? etc.

but **Do you know** where **Tom has** gone? (not has Tom gone)

When the question (**Where has Tom gone?**) is part of a longer sentence (**Do you know**...?/ **I don't know**.../ **Can you tell me**...? etc.), the word order changes.

Use **if** or **whether** where there is no other question word (**what, why** etc.):
- Did anybody see you? 
    - I don't know **if** anybody saw me.
    - **whether** anybody saw me.

## Part B
He asked me where....
- direct
    - The police officer said to us 'Where **are you going**'
    - The police officer asked us where **we were going**.
- reported
    - Clare asked 'What time **do the shops close'?
    - Clare wanted to know what time 'the shops closed'.

In reported speech the verb usually changes to the past (**were, closed** etc.)

Study these examples. You had a job interview and the interviewer asked you these questions:

Later you tell a friend what the interviewer asked you. You use reported speech:
- She asked if (or whether) **I was** willing to travel.
- She wanted to know what **I did** in my spare time.
