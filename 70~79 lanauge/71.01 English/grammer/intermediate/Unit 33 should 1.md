# Unit 33 should 1
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A 
You **should do** something = it is a good thing to do or the right thing to do.
You can use **should** to **give advice or to give an opinion**:
- You look tired. You **should go** to bed.
- The government **should do** more to improve schools.

You **shouldn't** do something = it isn't a good thing to do:
- You **shouldn't believe** everything you read in newspapers.

We often use **should** with **I think / I don't think / Do you think**...?:
- I **think** the government **should do** more to improve schools.

**Should** is not as strong as **must** or **have to**:
- You **should** apologise. (= it would be a good thing to do)
- You **must** apologise. / You **have to** apologise. (= you have no alternative)

## Part B
We use **should** when something is not right or what we expect:
- Where's Tina? She **should be** here by now. (= she isn't here yet, and this is not normal)
- The price on this packet is wrong. it **should be** $2.5, not $3.5

We also use **should** to say that we expect something to happen:
- Helen has been studying hard for the exam, so she **should pass**. (=I expect her to pass)
- There are plenty of hotels in the town. It **shouldn't be** hard to find a place to stay. (= I don't expect it to be hard)

## Part C
You **should have done** something = you didn't do it, but it would have been a good thing to do:
- You missed a great party last night. You **should have come**. Why didn't you? (= you didn't come, but it would have been good to come)

You **shouldn't have done** something = you did it, but it wasn't a good thing to do:
- I'm feeling sick. I **shouldn't have eaten** so much. (= I ate too much)
- She **shouldn't have been listening** to our conversation. It was private. (= she was listening)

Compare **should** (do) and **should have** (done):
- You look tired. You **should go** to bed now.
- You went to bed very late last night. You **should have gone** to bed earlier.

## Part D ought to...
You can use **ought to** instead of **should** in the sentences on this page.
We say 'ought **to** do (with **to**)':
- Do you think I **ought to apply** for this job? (= Do you think I **should apply**...?)
- Jack **ought not to go** to bed so late. (= Jack **shouldn't go**...)
- It was a great party last night. You **ought to have come**. (= You **should have come**)
