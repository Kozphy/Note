# Unit 71 Countable nouns with **a/an** and **some**
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A Countable nouns can be singular or plural
- a dog / dogs
- a child / some children
- the evening / the evenings
- this party / these parties
- an umbrella / two umbrellas

You cannot use singular countable nouns alone (without **a/the/my** etc.)

## Part B 
We use **a/an**... to say what kind of thing something is, or what kind of pperson somebody is:
- That's a **nice table**.

In the plural we use the noun alone (not some...):
- Those are **nice chairs**. (not some nice chairs)

We say that somebody has **a long nose/ a nice face/ blue eyes / long fingers** etc.

We use **a/an** when we say what somebody's job is:
- Sandra is **a nurse**. (not Sandra is nurse)
- Would you like to be **an English teacher**?

## Part C We use **some** in two ways
(1) some = a number (of) / a few (of) / a pair (of):
- I've seen **some** good **movies** recently. (not I've seen good movies)
- **Some friends** of mine are coming to stay at the weekend.

Often you can say the same thing with or without **some**.
- I need (**some**) **new clothes**.
- The room was empty apart from a table and (**some**) chairs.

Do not use **some** when you are talking about things in general (see Unit 75):
- I love **bananas**. (not some bananas)

(2) **some** = some but not all
- **Some children** learn very quickly. (not not all children)
- Tomorrow there will be rain in **some places**, but most of the country will be dry.
