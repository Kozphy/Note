# Unit 49 Questions 1
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
In questions the subject is usually after the first verb:
- verb + Subject
    - **Will Tom** be here tomorrow?
    - **Have you** been working hard?

## Part B
In present simple questions, we use **do/does**:
- **Do** you **live** near here?

In past simple questions, we use **did**:
- **Did** you **sell** your car?

But do not use **do/does/did** if **who/what** etc. is he subject of the sentence.
Compare:
- who object
    - Emma phoned somebody(object)
    - Who(object) **did** Emma phone
- who subject
    - **Somebody** phoned Emma.
    - Who **phoned** Emma? 

## Part C
In question beginning **who/what/which/where**, prepositions (**in, for** etc.) usually go at the end:

You can use preposition + **whom** in formal style:
- **To whom** do you wish to speak?

## Part D
**isn't it...? / didn't you...?** etc. (negative questions)
We use negative questions especially to show surprise:
- **Didn't you** hear the doorbell? I rang it three times.

or when we expect the listener to agree with us:
- **Haven't we** met before? Yes, I think we have.
