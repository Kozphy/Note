###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
Sometimes we use two or more adjectives together:
- My brother lives in a **nice new** house.

Adj like **new/large/round/wooden** are fact adjectives, They give use information about age, size colour etc.

Adj like **nice/beautiful** are *opinion* adjectives. They tell us what the speaker thinks of something or somebody.

**Opinion adj usually go before fact adj**.


|  | opinion | fact |     |
| -------- | ------- | ---- | --- |
| a     | **nice**    | **long** | summer holiday|



## Part B
Sometimes we use two or more fact adj together. Usually (not always) we put fact adj.
1. how big
2. how old?
3. what colour?
4. where from
5. what is it made of?
6. Noun

Adj of size and length(**big/small/tall/short/long** etc.) usually go before adj of shape and width (**round/fat/thin/slim/wide** etc.)

When there are two or more colour adj, we use **and**.

This does not usually happen with other adj before a noun.

## Part C
We use adj after **be/get/become/seem**

We also use adj to say how somebody/something looks, feels, sounds, tastes or smells

But to say how somebody does something you must use an adverb (see Units 100~101)

We say 'the **first two** days', the **next few** weeks, 'the **last ten** minutes' etc.
