# Unit 15 Past perfect (I had done)
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`
P.30

## Part A
The past perfect (simple) is **had** + past particle (**gone/seen/finished** etc.).

Sometimes we talk about something that happened in the past:
- Sarah **arrived** at the party.

This is the starting point of the story. Then, if we want to talk about things that happened before this time, we use the past perfect (**had**...):
- **When Sarah arrived** at the party, Paul **had** already **gone** home.

## Part B
Compare present perfect (**have seen** etc.) and past perfect (**had seen** etc.):
- Present perfect
    - Who is that woman? I'**ve seen** her before, but I can't remember where.
    - We aren't hungry. We'**ve** just **had** lunch.
- Past perfect
    - I wasn't sure who she was. I'**d seen** her before, but I couldn't remember where.
    - We weren't hungry. We'**d** just **had** lunch.

## Part C
Compare past simple (**left, was** etc.) and past perfect (**had left, had been** etc.):
- Past simple
    - A: Was Tom there when you arrived?
        - B: Yes, but he **left** soon afterwards.
    - Kate **wasn't** at home when I phoned.
        - She **was** at her mother's house.
- Past perfect
    - A: Was Tom there when you arrived?
        - B: No, he'**d** already **left**.
    - Kate **had** just **got** home when I phoned.
        - She'**d been** at her mother's house.
