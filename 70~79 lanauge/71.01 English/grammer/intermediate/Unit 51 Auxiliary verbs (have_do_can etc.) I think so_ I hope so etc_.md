###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A auxiliary verb and main verb
||auxiliary|main||
|--|--|--|--|
|I|**have**|**lost**|my keys|
|She|**can't**|**come**|to the party.|
|The hotel| **was**|**built**|ten years ago.|
|Why|**do** you| **want**|to go home?|

In these examples **have/can't/was/do** are auxiliary (=helping) verbs.

You can use an auxiliary verb when you don't want to repeat something:
- 'Have you locked the door?' Yes, I **have**. (=I have locked the door)
- Gary wasn't working, but Laura **was**. (= Laura was working)
- Jessical could lend me the money, but she **won't** (= she won't lend me the money)

We use **do/does/did** for the present and past simple:
- Do you like onions? 'Yes, I **do**' (I like onions)
- Does Simon live in London? He **did**, but he **doesn't** any more.

You can use auxiliary verbs to deny what somebody says (= say it is not true):
- You're sitting in my place. No, I'**m not**. (= I'm not sitting in your place)

## Part B 
We use **have you? / Isn't she? / are they?** etc. to show that we are interested in what somebody has said, or to show surprise:
- I've just seen Steven. Oh, **have you**? How is he?
- Lisa isn't very well today. **Isn't she**? What's wrong with her.

## Part C
We use auxiliary verbs with **so** and **neither**.
- I'm tired. **So am I**. (I tired too)
- I never read newspapers. **Neither do I**. (= I never read newspapers either)

Note the word order after **so** and **neither** (verb before subject)
- I passed the exam and **so did Paul**. (not so Paul did)

Instead of **neither**, you can use **nor**. You can also use **not...either**:
- I don't know. **Neither** do I. or **Nor** do I. or I do**n't either**.

## Part D I think so / I suppose so etc.
You can say **I think so / I suppose so** etc. when we don't want to repeat something:
- Are those people Korean? **I think so**. (= I think they are Korean)
- Is Kate working tomorrow? **I suppose so**. (= I suppose she is working tomorrow)
- Will you be at home this evening? **I expect so**. (= I expect I'll be at home)

In the same way we say **I hope so, I guess so** and **I'm afraid so**.


The usual negative forms are:
I think so/ I expect so --> I **don't think so / I don't expect so**
I hope so / I'm afraid so --> I **hope not / I'm afraid not**
I guess so/ I suppose so --> I **guess not/ I suppose not**
