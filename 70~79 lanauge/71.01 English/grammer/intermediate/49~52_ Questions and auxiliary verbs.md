# 49~52: Questions and auxiliary verbs
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Unit 49 question 1
### Part A In questions we usually put the subject after the first verb.
| subject + verb | verb + subject |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Tom will      | will Tom?      |
| you have       | have you?      |
| the house was  | was the house? |

- **Will Tom** be here tomorrow?
- **Have you** been working hard?
- When **was the house built**?
- **Is** Katherine **working** today?

### Part B In present simple question and past simple questions
In persent simeple questions, we use **do/does**:
| describe        | question                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------ |
| you live        | do you **live**?         |
| the film starts | does the film **start**? |

- **Do** you **live** near here?
- What time **does** the film **start**?

In past simple questions we use **did**:
| describe          | question                    |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| you sold          | **did** you **sell**?       |
| the train stopped | **did** the train **stop**? |

- **Did** you **sell** your car?
- Why **did** the train **stop**?

But do not use **do/does/did** if **who/what** etc. is the subject of the sentence. Compare
| who object                  | who subject           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Emma phoned somebody(object).       | somebody(subject) phoned Emma. |
| Who(object) **did** Emma **phone**? | Who(subject) **phoned** Emma?  |

In these examples, **who/want** etc. is the subject:
- **Who wants** something to eat? (not Who does want)
- **What happened** to you last night? (not What did happen)
- **How many people came** to the meeting? (not did come)
- **Which bus goes** to the centre? (not does go)

### Part C Who/What/Which/Where in question
Note the position of prepositions in questions beginning **Who/What/Which/Where**...?
- **Who** do you want to speak **to**?
- **What** was the weather **like** yesterday?
- **Which** job has Tina applied **for**?
- **Where** are you **from**?

You can use preposition + **whom** in formal style:
- **To whom** do you wish to speak?

### Part D Isn't it ...? / Didn't you etc. (negative questions)
We use negative questions especially to show surprise:
- **Didn't you** hear the doorbell? I rang it three times.

or when we expect the listener to agree with us:
- **Haven't we** met before? Yes, I think we have.

Note the meaning of **yes** and **no** in answers to negative questions:
- **Don't you** want to go?
    - **Yes**. (= Yes, I want to go)
    - **No**. (= No, I don't want to go)

Note the word order in negative questions beginning **Why**...?:
- **Why don't we** eat out tonight? (not Why we don't eat)
- **Why wasn't Emma** at work yesterday? (not Why Emma wasn't)


## Unit 50 Questions 2 (Do you know where...? / He asked me where ...)
### Part A Do you know where...? / I don't know why... / Could you tell me what ...? etc.
We say: Where **has Tom** gone?
but: Do you know where **Tom has** gone? (not Do you know where has Tom gone?)

When the question (**Where has Tom gone?**) is part of a longer sentence (**Do you know...? / I don't know .../ Can you tell me...?** etc.), the word order changes. We say:
- What time **is it**? -> **Do you know** what time **it is**?
- Who **are those people**? -> **I don't know** who **those people are**.
- Where **can I** find Louise? -> **Can you tell me** where **I can** find Louise?
- How much **will it** cost? -> **Do you have any idea** how much **it will** cost?

Be careful with **do/does/did** questions. We say:
- What time **does the film start**? -> **Do you know** what time **the film starts**? (not does the film start)
- What **do you mean**? -> **Please explain** what **you mean**.
- Why **did she leave** early? -> **I wonder** why **she left** early.

Use **if** or **whether** where there is no other question word (**what**, **why** etc.):
- Did any body see you? -> Do you know **if** anybody saw you? or ...**whether** anybody saw you?

### Part B He asked me where... (reported questions)
The same changes in word order happen in reported questions. Compare:
- direct
    - The police officer said to us 'Where **are you going**?'
    - Clare said 'What time **do the banks close**'
- reported
    - The police officer asked us where **we were going**.
    - Clare wanted to know what time **the banks closed**.

In reported speech the verb usually changes to the past (**were, closed** etc.). See Unit 47.

Study these examples. You had an interview for a job and these were some of the questions the interviewer asked you:
- **Are you** willing to travel?
- What **do you do** in your spare time?
- How long **have you** been working in your present job?
- Why **did you apply** for the job?
- **Can you speak** any other language?
- **Do you have** a dirving licence?

Later you tell a friend what the interviewer asked you. You use reported speech:
- She asked if (or whether) **I was** willing to travel.
- She wanted to know what **I did** in my spare time.
- She asked how long **I had** been working in my present job.
- She asked why **I had** applied for the job. (or ...why I **applied**)
- She wanted to know if (or whether) **I could** speak any other languages.
- She asked if (or whether) **I had** a driving licence.

## Unit 51 Auxiliary verbs (have/do/can etc.) I think so / I how so etc.
### Part A Auxiliary verb and main verb
In each of these sentences there is an auxiliary verb and a main verb:
- I **have lost** my keys.
- She **can't come** to the party.
- The hotel **was built** ten years ago.
- Where **do** you **live**?

In these example **have/can't/was/do** are auxiliary (= helping) verbs.

You can use an auxiliary verb when you don't want to repeat something:
- Have you looked the door? Yes, I **have**. (= I have locked the door)
- Gary wasn't working, but Laura **was**. (= Laura was working)
- Jessica could lend me the money, but she **won't** (= she won't lend me the money)

Use **do/does/did** for the present and past simple:
- Do you like onions? Yes, I **do**. (= I like onions)
- Does Simon live in London? He **did**, but he **doesn't** any more.

You can use auxiliary verbs to deny what somebody says (= say it is not ture):
- You're sitting in my place. No, I'**m not**. (= I'm not sitting in you place)
- You didn't lock the door before you left. Yes, I **did**. (= I locked the door)

### Part B have you? / isn't she? / do they?
We use **have you? / isn't she? / do they**? etc. to show interest in what somebody has said, or to show surprise:
- I've just seen Stephen. Oh, **have you**? How is he?
- Lisa isn't very well today. Oh, **isn't she**? What's wrong with her?
- It rained every day during our holiday. **Did it**? What a shame!
- James and Tanya are getting married. **Are they**? Really?

### Part C so / neither / nor / not...either
We use auxiliary verbs with **so** and **neither**:
- I'm tired. **So am I**. (= I'm tired too)
- I never read newspapers. **Neither do I**. (= I never read newspapers either)
- Sarah hasn't got a car and **neither has Mark**.

Note the word order after **so** and **neither** (verb before subject):
- I passed the exam and **so did Paul**. (not so Paul did)

Instead of **neither**, you can **nor**. You can also use **not ... either**:
- I don't know. **Neither** do I. or **Nor** do I. or I **don't either**.

### Part D I think so / I hope so etc.
After some verbs we use **so** when we don't want to repeat something:
- Are those people Korean? I think so. (= I think they are Korean)
- Will you be at home this evening? **I expect so**. (= I expect I'll be at home...)
- Do you think Kate has been invited to the party? **I suppose so**.
In the same way we say: **I hope so, I guess so** and **I'm afraid so**.

The usual negative forms are:
- I think so/ I expect so -> I **don't think so** / I **don't expect so**
- I hope so/ I'm afraid so/ I guess so -> I **hope not**/ I'**m afraid not**/ I **guess not**
- I suppose so -> I **don't suppose so** or I **suppose not**

- Is that woman American? **I think so./ I don't think so**.
- Do you think it will rain? **I hope so. / I hope not** (not I don't hope so)

## Unit 52 Question tags (do you? isn't it etc.)
### Part A example
- You haven't seen Lisa today, **have you**? No, I haven't.
- It was a good film, **wasn't it**? Yes, it was great.

**Have you?** and **wasn't it**? are question tags (= mini-questions that we often put on the end of a sentence in spoken English). In question tags, we use an auxiliary verb (**have/ was/ will** etc).
We use **do / does / did** for the present and past simple (see Unit 51):
- Karen plays the piano, **doesn't she?** Well, yes, but not very well.
- You didn't lock the door, **did** you? No, I forgot.

### Part B when to use negative question tag or positive question tag
Normally we use a negative question tag after a positive sentence:
| positive sentence           | negative tag  |
| --------------------------- | ------------- |
| Kate **will** be here soon, | won't she?    |
| There **was** a lot of traffic, | wasn't there? |
| Joe **should** pass the exam, | shouldn't he?              |

positive question question tag after a negative sentence:
| negative sentence          | positive tag |
| -------------------------- | ------------ |
| Kate **won't** be late,    | will she?    |
| They **don't** like us,    | do they?     |
| You **haven't** eaten yet, | have you?    |

Notice the meaning of **yes** and **no** in answer to a negative sentence:
- You're **not** going out today, **are you?**
    - Yes. (= Yes, I am going out)
    - No. (= No, I am not going out)

### Part C The meaning of a question tag depends on how you say it. 
If your voice goes down, you are not really asking a question, you are only inviting the listener to agree with you
- It's a nice day, **isn't it**? Yes, beautiful.
- Paul doesn't look well today, **does he**? No, he looks very tired.
- Lisa's very funny. She's got a great sense of humour, **hasn't she**? Yes she has.

But if the voice goes up, it is a real question:
- You haven't seen Lisa today, **have you**? No, I haven't.(= Have you by chance seen Lisa today?)

You can use a negative sentence + positive tag to ask for things or information, or to ask somebody to do something. The voice goes up at the end of the tag in sentences like these:
- You haven't got a pen, **have you**? Yes, here you are.
- You couldn't do me a favour, **could you**? It depends what it is.
- You don't know hwere Karen is, **do you**? Sorry, I have no idea.

### Part D After Let's / Don't / I'm, question tag
After **Let's ...** the question tag is **shall we**:
- **Let's** go for a walk, **shall we**? (the voice goes up)

After **Don't**..., the question tag is **will you**:
- **Don't** be late, **will you**? (the voice goes down)

After **I'm**..., the negative question tag is **aren't I** (= am I not):
- I'm right, **aren't I**? Yes, you are.
