# Unit 20 I'm going to (do)
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A 
I **am going to do** something = I have already decided to do it, I intend to do it:
- I'**m** just going to make a quick phone call. Can you wait for me?
- This cheese smells horrible. I'**m not going to eat** it.

## Part B
**I am doing** and **I am going to do**
**I am doing** = it is already fixed or arranged.
- I'**m leaving** next week. I've booked my flight.
- What time **are** you **meeting** Emily this evening?

I **am going to do** something = I've decided to do it. Maybe I've arranged to do it, maybe not.
- A: Your shoes are dirty.
    - B: Yes, I know. I'**m going to clean** them. (= I've decided to clean them, but I haven't arranged this with anybody)

Compare:
- I don't know what I'**m doing** tomorrow. (= I don't know my schedule or plans)
- I don't know what I'**m going to do** about the problem. (I haven't decided what to do)

## Part C
You can also say that something **is going to happen** in the future.
- Look at those black clouds! It'**s going to rain**. (we can see the clouds now)

## Part D
I **was going to** do something = I intended to do it, but didn't do it:
- We **were going to travel** by train, but then we decided to drive instead.
- I **was** just **going to cross** the road when somebody shouted 'Stop!'

You can say that 'something **was going to happen**' (but didn't happen)
- I thought it **was going to rain**, but it didn't.
