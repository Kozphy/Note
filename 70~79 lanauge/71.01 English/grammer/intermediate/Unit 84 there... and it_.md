# Unit 84 **there...** and **it...**
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A example
- girl: **There's** a new restaurant in Hill Street.
- boy: Yes, I know. I've heard it's very good.

We use **there...** when **we talk about something for the first time, to say that it exists**

**It** = a specific thing, place, fact, situation etc.

Compare **there and it**:
- I like this town. **There**'s a lot to do here. **It**'s an interesting place.

**There** also means 'to/at/in that place'

## Part B You can say


| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | --------|
| there will be     | there must have been     | there is sure to be     |there is likely to be|
|there must be| there should have been| there is bound to be| there is supposed to be|
|there might be etc.| there would have been etc.| there is going to be| there used to be|

Compare **there** and **it**:
- They live on a busy road. **There must be** a lot of noise from the traffic.
    - They live on a busy road. **It muse be** very noisy. (**it** = living on a busy road)
- **There used to be** a cinema here, but it closed a few years ago.
    - That building is now a supermarket. **It used to be** a cinema. (**It** = that building)
- **There's sure to be** a flight to Rome tonight.
    - There's a flight to Rome tonight, but **it's usre to be** full. (**it** = the flight)

## Part C We say:
- **It**'s dangerous **to walk in the road**. (not To walk in the road is dangerous)

Normally we use **it...** at the begining of sentences like this.

We also use **it** to talk about distance, time and weather

Compare **it** and **there**
- **It** was **windy**. but **There** was a **cold wind**.
