# Unit 45 it is said that... he is said to... he is supposed to...
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A situation
George is very old. Nobody knows exactly how old he is, but
- **It is said that** he is 108 years old.
- He **is said to be** 108 years old.

Both these sentences mean: People say that he is 108 years old.

## supposed to...
You can use **supposed to**... in the same way as **said to**...:
- I want to see that film, It'**s supposed to be** good. (= people say it's good)
- There are many stories about Joe. He'**s supposed to have robbed** a bank many years ago.
- Fireworks **are supposed to have been invented** in China. Is it true?

Sometimes **supposed to**... has a different meaning. We use **supposed to** say what is intended, arranged or expected. Often this is different from the real situation:
- The plan **is supposed to be** a secret, but everybody seems to know about it. (= the plan is intended to be a secret)
- Why are you doing at work? You'**re supposed to be** on holiday. (= you arranged to be on holiday)

**You're not supposed to** do something = it is not allowed or advised:
- **You're not supposed to park** your car here. It's private parking only.
- Joe is much better after his illness, but **he's not supposed to exercise** too hard.
