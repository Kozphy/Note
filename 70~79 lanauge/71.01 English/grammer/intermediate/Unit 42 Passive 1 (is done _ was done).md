# Unit 42 Passive 1 (is done / was done)
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
When we use an active verb, we say what the subject does:
- My grandfather was a builder. **He built** this house in 1981.

**When we use a passive verb, we say what happens to the subject**:
- How old is this house? **It was built** in 1981.
- **Two hundred people are employed** by the company.

## Part B
When we use the passive, who or what causes the action is often unknown or unimportant:
- A lot of money **was stolen** in the robbery. (somebody stole it, but we don't know who)
- **Is** this room **cleaned** every day? (does somebody clean it? - it's not important who)

if we want to say who does causes the action, we use by:
- This house was built **by my grandfather**.

## Part C
The passive is **be (is/was** etc) + past participle (**done/cleaned/seen** etc.):
- (be) done
- (be) cleaned
- (be) damaged
- (be) built
- (be) seen
