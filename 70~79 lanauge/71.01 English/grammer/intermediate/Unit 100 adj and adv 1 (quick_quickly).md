###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
You can say:
- Our holiday was too short - the time passed very **quickly**.
- Two people were **seriously** injured in the accident.

**Quickly** and **seriously** are adverbs. Many adverbs are **adj + -ly**


Not all words ending in **-ly** are adverbs. Some adj end in **-ly** too, for ex:
- friendly
- lively
- elderly
- lonely
- lovely

## Part B
Adj or adv?

Adj (**quick/careful** etc.) tell us about a noun (somebody or something). We use adj before nouns:
- Sam is **careful driver**. (not a care fully driver)
- We didn't go out because of the **heavy rain**.


Adverbs (**quickly/carefully** etc.) tell us about a verb (how somebody does something or how something happens):
- Sam **drove carefully** along the narrow road. (not drove careful)
- We didn't go out because it was **raining heavily** (not raining heavy)

Compare
- She speaks **perfect English**. (adj + noun)
- She **speaks** English **perfectly**. (verb + noun + adverb)

## Part C
We use adj after some verbs, especially **be**, and also **look/feel/sound** etc.

Compapre:
- type 1
    - Please **be quiet**.
    - My exam results **were** really **bad**.
    - Why do you always **looks** so **serious**?
    - I **feel happy**.
- type 2
    - Please **speak quietly**.
    - I **did** really **badly** in the exam.
    - Why do you never **take** me **seriously**.
    - The children were **playing happily**.

## Part D
You can also use adverbs before adj and other adverbs. for ex:
- **reasonably** cheap (adv + adj)
- **terribly** sorry (adv + adj)
- **incredibly** qucikly (adv + adv)

You can also use an adv before a p.p. (**injured/organised/written** etc.):
- Two people people were **seriously injured** in the accident. (not serious injured)
- The conference was **badly organised**.
