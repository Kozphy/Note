# Unit 31 have to and must
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
I **have to** do something = it is necessary to do it, I am obliged to do it:
- You can't turn right here. You **have to turn** left.

We use **do/does/did** in questions and negative sentences (for the present and past simple):
- What **do** I **have to do** to get a new driving licence? (not What have I to do?)
- Karen **doesn't have to work** Saturdays. (not Karen hasn't to)

You can say **I'll have to...**, **I'm going to have to**..., **I might have to**..., **I may have to**...:
- They can't repair my computer, so I'**ll have to buy** a new one.
- We **might have to change** our plans. (= it's possible that we will have to change them)

## Part B
**Must** is similar to **have to**. You can say:
- It's later than I thought. I **must go**. or I **have to go**.

You can use **must** or **have to** when you give your own opinion (for ex, to say what you think is necessary, or to recommend someone to do something):
- I haven't spoken to Sue for ages. I **must phone** her. / I **have to phone** her. (= I say this is necessary)
- Mark is a really nice person. You **must meet** him. / You **have to meet** him. (= I recommend this)

We use **have to** (not usually **must**) to say what someone is obliged to do. This is a fact, not the speaker's own opinion:
- I **have to work** from 8.30 to 5.30 every day. (a fact, not an opinion)

But we use **must** in written rules and instructions:
- Applications for the job **must be receivd** by 18 May.

We use **had to** (not **must**) to talk about the past:
- I went to the meeting yesterday, but I **had** to leave early. (not I must)

## Part C
**Mustn't** and **don't have to** are completely different:
- You **mustn't** do something = don't do it:
    - You **must keep** this a secret. You **mustn't tell** anyone. (= don't tell anyone)

- You **don't have to** do something = you don't need to do it (but you can if you want):
    - You **don't have to come** with me. I can go alone.

## Part D
You can use **have got to** instead of **have to**. You can say:
- I'**ve got to** work tomorrow. or I **have to** work tomorrow.
- When **has** Helen **got to** go? or When **does** Helen **have to** go?
