# Unit 41 wish
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
We say '**wish** somebody **luck/ all the best/ success**' etc.
- **I wish you all the best** in the future.

We say 'wish somebody something' (**luck, happiness** etc.), but we do not say 'I wish something happens'. We use **hope** in this situation:
- I'm sorry you're not well. I **hope** you **feel** better soon. (not I wish you feel)

## Part B
We also use **wish** to say that we regret something that something is not as we could like it.
When we use **wish** in this way, we use the past (**knew/lived** etc),but the meaning is present:
- I **wish** I **knew** what to do about the problem. (but I don't know)

To say that we regret something that happened before, we use **wish + had** known / **had** said etc.:
- I **wish** I'**d known** about the party. I'd have gone if I'd known.

## Part C
**I wish I could** (**do** something) = I regret that I cannot do it:
- I'm sorry you have to go. I **wish** you **could stay** longer. (but you can't)

**I wish I could have** (**done** something) = I regret that I could not do it:
- I hear the party was great. I **wish** I **could have gone**. (but I couldn't go)

## Part D
You can say 'I **wish** something **would** happen.'
It's been raining all day. Tanya doesn't like it. She says:
**I wish** it **would stop** raining.

Tanya would like the rain to stop, but this will probably not happen.

We use **I wish ... would** when we would like something to happen or change.

We often use **I wish ... would** to complain about a situation:
- The phone has been ringing for five minutes. **I wish** somebody **would answer** it.

You can use **I wish...wouldn't...** to complain about things that people do repeatedly:
- **I wish** you **wouldn't keep** interrupting me. (= please stop interrupting me)

## Part E
We use **I wish... would...** to say that we want something to happen. We do not use **I wish...would** to say how we would like things to be. Compare:
- I **wish** Sarah **would** come. (= I want her to come)
- I **wish** Sarah **was (or were)** here now. (not I wish Sarah would be)
