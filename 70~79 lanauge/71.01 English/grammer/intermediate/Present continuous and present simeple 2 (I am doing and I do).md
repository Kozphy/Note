# Present continuous and present simeple 2 (I am doing and I do)
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A continuous forms
We use continuous forms (I'**m waiting**, it **'s raining** etc.) for actions and happining that `have started but not finished`.

Some verbs are not normally used in this way. We don't say 'I am knowing, they are liking'. We say 'I **know**', 'they **like**'

The following verbs are not normally used in the present continuous:
- like, want, need, prefer
- know, realise, understand, recognise
- believe, suppose, remember, mean
- belong, fit. contain, consist, seem

## Part B think
When **think** means 'believe' or 'have an opinion', we do not use the continuous:
- I **think** Mary is Canadian, but I'm not sure. (not I'm thinking)
- What **do** you **think** of my idea? (= what is your opinion?)

When **think** means 'consider', the continuous is possible:
- I'**m thinking** about what happened. I often **think** about it.
- Nicky **is thinking** of giving up her job. (= she is considering it)

## Part C see hear smell taste look feel
We normally use the present simple (not continuous) with **see/hear/smell/taste**:
- **Do** you **see** that man over there? (not are you seeing)
- The room **smells**. Let's open a window.

You can use the present simple or continuous to say how somebody **looks** or **feels** now:
- You **look** well today. or You**'re looking** well today.
- How **do** you **feel** now? or How **are** you **feeling** now?

but
- I usually **feel** tired in the morning. (not I'm usually feeling)

## Part D am/is/are being
You can say **he's being..., you're being...** etc. to say how somebody is behaving now:
- I can't understand why he'**s being** so selfish. He isn't like that (being selfish = behaving selfishly now)
- 'The path is icy. Don't slip.' Don't worry. I'**m being** very careful.'

Compare:
- He never thinks about other. He'**s** very selfish. (= he is selfish generally, not only now)
- I don't like to take risks. I'**m** a very careful person.

We use **am / is / are being** to say how a preson behaving (= doing something they can control) now. It is not usually possible in other situations:
- Sam **is** ill. (not being ill)
- **Are** you tired? (not ary you being tired)
