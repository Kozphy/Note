# Unit 38 if I do... and if I did..
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A situation
### (1)
LISA: Shall we take the bus or the train?
JESS: **If we take** the bus, it **will** be cheaper.

For Jess, it is possible that they will take the bus, so she says:
- **If** we **take** the bus, it **will** be...

### (2)
Lisa and Jess decide to take the train.
Later, Jess talks to Joe.
JOE: How are you going to travel?
JESS: We're going to take the train. **If we took** the bus, it **would** be cheaper, but the train is quicker.

Now Jess knows they are not going to take the bus, so she say:
**If** we **took** the bus, it **would** be....

## Part B
When we talk about something that will not happen, or we don't expect that it will happen, we use **if** + past (**if** we **went** / **if** there **was** etc.)
But the meaning is not past:
- What would you do **if** you **won** a lot of money? (I don't really expect this to happen)
- I'd be surprised **if** they **didn't come** to the party. (I expect them to come)
