# Unit 40 If I had known... I wish I had known
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A situation
Last month Gary was in hospital for a few days. Rachel didn't know this. A few days ago they met by chance. Rachel said:
- **If I'd known** you were in hospital,**I would have gone** to visit you. (= I didn't know, so I didn't go to visit you)
**If I'd known** = If I **had** known. This tells us that she didn't know before.

We use **if + had ('d)** to talk about the past (**if I'd known / if you'd done** etc.)

Compare:
- I'm not hungry. **If** I **was** hungry,I would eat something. (now)
- I wasn't hungry. **If** I **had been** hungry, I would have eaten something. (past)

The short form **'d** can be **would** or **had**:
- if I'**d seen** you. (I'**d** seen = I **had** seen)
- I'**d have said** hello. (I'**d** have said = I **would** have said)

## Part C
We use **had done/known/been** etc. in the same way after **wish**.
I **wish** something **had happened** = I am sorry that it didn't happen
I **wish** something **hadn't happened** = I am sorry that it happened

## Part D
Compare **would (do)** and **would have (done)**:
- if I'd gone to the party last night, I **would be** tired now. (I am not tired now - present)
- if I'd gone to the party last night, I **would have met** a lots of people. (I didn't meet lots of people - past)

Compare **would have**, **could have** and **might have**:
- if the weather hadn't been so bad
    - we **would have gone** out.
    - we **could have gone** out. (= we would have been able to go out)
    - we **might have gone** out. (= maybe we would have gone out)
