# Unit 90 **all** **every** **whole**
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
**everybody/everyone/everything** and **all**

We do not often use **all** alone in this way. We do not say 'all were happy', 'he knows all' etc.

We use **all** in the following ways:
- **all** + noun (**all cars**, **all my money** etc)
- **all of** + **us/you/them**
- **we/you/they ...**all**... (see also Unit 110D)
- **all about**...
- **all...** = the only thing(s)
- **All my friends** were happy.
- **All of us** were happy.
- **All of us** were happy.
- **We** were **all** happy.
- He knows **all about computers**.
- **All I've eaten today** is a banana. (= the only thing I've eaten today)

## Part B
**whole** and **all**

**Whole** = complete, entire. We use **whole** mostly with singular nouns

We do not normally use **whole** with uncountable nouns (**water, food, money** etc.)

We use **the/my/a** etc. before **whole**. Compare **whole** and **all**:
- I read **the whole** book.
- I read **all the** information.

## Part C
**every day / all day / the whole day**
We use **every** to say hoe often something happens (**every day/ every ten minutes** etc.)

**All day** or **the whole day** = the complete day from beginning to end.

Note that we say **all day** (not all the day), **all week** (not all the week) etc.

Compare **all the time** and **every time**.

## Part D
**Every/everybody/everyone/everything** are singular words, so we use a singular verb.

But we use **they/them/their** after **everybody/everyone**
