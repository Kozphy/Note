# Unit 17 have and have got
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A 
**have** and **have got** (= for possession, relationships, illnesses, appointments etc.)

You can use **have** or **have got**. There is no difference in meaning. You can say:
- They **have** a new car. or They'**ve got** a new car.
- Lisa **has** two brothers. or Lisa **has got** two brothers.
- I **have** a headache. or I'**ve got** a headache.

With these meanings (possession etc.), we do not use continuous forms (**I'm having** etc.):
- We're enjoy our holiday. We **have** / We'**ve got** a nice room in the hotel. (not We're having a nice room)

For the past we use **had** (usually without **got**):
- Lisa **had** long hair when she was a child.

## Part B
In questions and negative sentences there are three possible forms:
- **Do you have** any questions?
    - I **don't have** any questions.
- **Have you got** any questions?
    - I **haven't got** any questions.
- **Have you** any questions? (less usual)
    - I **haven't** any questions. (less usual)

In past questions and negative sentences, we use **did/didn't**:
- **Did** you **have** a car when you were living in Paris?
- I **didn't have** my phone, so I couldn't call you.

## Part C
**have breakfast / have a shower / have a good time** etc.
We also use **have** (but not have got) for things we do or experience.

**Have got** is not possible in these expressions. Compare:
- We're enjoying our holiday. We'**re having** a great time.
- Where's Mark? He'**s having** a shower.

In questions and negative sentences we use **do/does/did**:
- I **don't** usually **have** a big breakfast. (not I usually haven't)
- Where **does** Chris usually **have** lunch?
- **Did** you **have** trouble finding somewhere to stay? (not Had you)
