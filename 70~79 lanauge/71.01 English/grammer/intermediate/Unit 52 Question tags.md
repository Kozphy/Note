# Unit 52 Question tags
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
**Have you**? and **wasn't it**? are question tags. These are mini-questions that you can put on the end of a sentence.

In question tags, we use an auxiliary verb (**have/was/will** etc.).

We use **do/does/did** for the present and past simple:
- Karen plays the piano, **doesn't she**? Well, yes but not very well.
- You didn't lock the door, **did** you? No, I forgot.

## Part B
Normally we use a negative question tag after a positive sentence. 
- Kate **will** be here soon, **won't she**?
 
a positive question tag after a negaitve sentence
- Kate **won't** be late, **will she**?

Notice the meaning of **yes** and **no** in answer to a negative sentence:
- You're **not** going out this morning, **are you**? 
    - **Yes**.(= Yes, I am going out)
    - **No.** (= No, I am not going out)

## Part C
The meaning of a question tag depends on how you say it. if your voice goes down, you are not really asking a question. You expect the listener to agree with you
- It's a nice day, **isn't it**? Yes, beautiful.

You can use a negative sentence + positvie tag to ask for things or information, or to ask somebody to do something. The voice goes up at the end of the tag:
- You couldn't do me a favour, **could you**? It depends what it is.
- You don't know where Karen is, **do you**? Sorry, I have no idea.

## Part D
After **Let's**... (=**Let us**) the question tag is **shall we**:
- **Let's** go for a walk,**shall we**?

After **Don't**..., the question tag is **will you**:
- **Don't** be late, **will you**? (the voice goes down)

After **I'm**...., the negative question tag is **aren't I**? (= am I not?):
- I'm right, **aren't I**? Yes, you are
