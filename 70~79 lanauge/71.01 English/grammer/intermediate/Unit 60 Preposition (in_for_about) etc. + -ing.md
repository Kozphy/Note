# Unit 60 Preposition (in/for/about) etc. + -ing
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A If a preposition (in/for/about etc.) is followed by a verb, the verb ends in -ing
- Are you interested **in working** for us?

You can also say 'instead of **somebody** doing something', fed up with **people** doing something' etc:
- I'm fed up with **people** telling me what to do.

## Part B
### before -ing, after -ing:
- **Before going** out, I phoned Sarah. (not Before to go out)
- What did you do **after leaving** school?

### by -ing (to say how something happens):
- You can improve your English **by reading** more.

### without -ing
- We ran ten kilometres **without stopping**.

## Part C **to + -ing** (look forward **to doing** something etc.)
### We often use **to** + infinitive (to do / to see etc.)
- We decided **to travel** by train.

### But to is also a preposition (like in/for/about/with etc.) for ex
- We went from Paris **to Geneva**.
- I prefer tea **to coffee**.
- Are you looking forward **to the weekend**?

### If we use a preposition + verb, the verb ends in **-ing**
- I'm fed up **with travelling** by train.

### So when **to** is a preposition and it is followed by a verb, we use **to -ing**:
- I prefer driving **to travelling** by train. (not to travel)
- Are you looking forward **to going** on holiday? (not looking forward to go)
