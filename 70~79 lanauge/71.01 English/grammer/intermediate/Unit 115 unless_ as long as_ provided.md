# Unit 115 unless/ as long as/ provided
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A unless
example:
The club is for member only.
You can't go in **unless you are a member**.

This means:
You can't go in except if you are a member.
You can go in only if you are a member.

**unless** = except if

more ex of **unless**:
- I'll see you tomorrow **unless I have to work late**. (except if I have to work late)
- There are no buses to the beach. **Unless you have a car**, it's difficult to get there (= except if you have a car)

Instead of **unless** it is often possible to say **if...not**:
- **Unless we leave now**, we'll be late. or **If we don't leave now**, we'll...

## Part B **as long as/ so long as** and **provided / providing**
You can say **as long as** or **so long as** (= if, on condition that):
- You can borrow my car ${\text{as long as} \brace \text{so long as}}$ you promise not to drive too fast. (= You can borrow my car, but you must promise not to drive too fast. This is a condition.)

You can also say **provided (that)** or **providing (that)**:
- Travelling by car is convenient ${\text{provinded (that)} \brace \text{providing (that)}}$ you have somewhere to park. (= it's convenient but only if you have somewhere to park.)

## Part C **unless/ as long as** etc. for the future

When we are talking about the future, we do not use **will** after **unless / as long as / so long as / provided / providing**. We use a present tence (see Unit 25):
- I'm not going out **unless** it **stops** raining. (not unless it will stop)
- **Providing** the weather **is** good, we're going to have a picnic tomorrow. (not providing the weather will be good)
