# Unit 35 would
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
We use **would('d)/wouldn't** when we imagine a situation or action (= we think of something that is not real):
- It **would be** nice to buy a new car, but we can't afford it
- I'**d love** to live by the sea.

We use **would have (done)** when we imagine something that didn't happen in the past:
- They helped us a lot. I don't know what we'**d have done** without their help.
- It's a shame you didn't see the film. You **would have liked** it.

Compare **would (do)** and **would have (done)**:
- I **would call** Lisa, but I don't have her number. (now)
- I **would have called** Lisa, but I didn't have her number. (past)

We often use **would** in sentences with **if**:
- I **would call** Lisa **if** I had her number.
- I **would have called** Lisa **if** I'd had her number.


## Part B
Compare **will('ll)** and **would('d')**:
- I'**ll stay** a little longer. I've got plenty of time.
- I'**d stay** a little longer, but I really have to go now. (so I can't stay longer)

Sometimes **would/wouldn't** is the past of **will/won't**

Somebody **wouldn't do** something = he/she refused to do it:
- I tried to warn him, but he **wouldn't listen** to me. (= he refused to listen)
- The car **wouldn't start** (= it refused to start)

## Part C
You can use **would** to talk about things that happened regularly in the past:
- When we were children, we lived by the sea. In summber, if the weather was fine, we would all get up early and go far a swim. (= we did this regularly)
- Whenever Richard was angry. he **would** walk out of the room.

With this meaning **would** is similar to **used to**:
- Whenever Richard was angry, he **used to walk** out of the room.
