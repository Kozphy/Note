# Unit 24 will be doing and will have done
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A situation
- now
These people are standing in a queue to get into the cinema.
- half an hour from now
Half an hour from now, the cinema will be full.
Everyone **will be watching** the film.
- three hours from now
Three hours from now, the cinema will be empty.
The film **will have finished**.
Everyone **will have gone** home.

## Part B
I **will be doing** something (future continuous) = I will be in the middle of doing it:
- This time next week I'll be on holiday. I'**ll be lying** on the beach or **swimming** in the sea.

Compare **will be (do)ing** and **will**(do):
- Don't phone between 7 and 8. We'**ll be eating**.
- Let's wait from Liz to arrive and then we'**ll eat**.

Compare:
- At 10 o'clock yesterday, Tina **was** in her office. She **was working**. (past continuous)
- It's 10 o'clock now. She **is** in her office. She **is working**. (present continuous)
- At 10 o'clock tomorrow, she **will be** in her office. She **will be working**. (future continuous)

## Part C
We also use **will be -ing** to talk about complete actions in the future.

When we use it in this way, **will be (doing)** is similar to **will (do)** and **going to (do)**.

## Part D
I **will have done** something (future perfect) = it will be complete before a time in the future.

Compare:
- Ted and Amy **have been** married for 24 years. (present perfect)
- Next year they **will have been** married for 25 years. (future perfect)
- When their son was born, they **had been** married for three years. (past perfect)
