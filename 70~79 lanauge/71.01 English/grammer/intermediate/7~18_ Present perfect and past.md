###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## unit 7 Present perfect 1 (I have done)
### situation
Tom is looking for his key. He can't find it.
He **has lost** his key.

He **has lost** his key = He lost it recently, and he still doesn't have it.

**Have/has lost** is the present perfect simple

The present perfect simple is **have/has + past participle**

### When we say that "something has happened", this is usually new information
- Ow! I've cut my finger.
- The road is closed. There's been ( has been ) an accident.
- (from the news) Police **have arrested** two men in connection with the robbery.

### When we use the present perfec, there is a connection with now. The action is the past has a result now
- Where's your key? I don't know. I've lost it. (= I don't have it now)
- He told me his name, but I've forgotten it (= I can't remember it now)
- Is Sally here? No, she's gone out. (= she is out now) or Not, she went out.
- I can't find my bag. Have you seen it? (= Do you know where is it now?)

### Difference between gone(to) and been(to)
- James is on holiday. He has gone to Italy. (= he is there now or on his way there)
- Jane is back home now. She has been to Italy. (= she has now come back)

### You can use the present perfect with just, already and yet.
just = a short time ago
- Are you hungry? No, I've just had lunch. or No, I just had lunch.
- Hello. Have you just arrived?

We use already to say that something happened sooner than expected
- Don't forget to pay your eletricity bill. I've already paid it.
- What time is Mark leaving? He's already left.

Yet = until now. Yet shows that the speaker is expecting something to happen. Use yet only in questions and negative sentences
- **Has** it **stopped** yet?
- I've written the email, but I **haven't sent it yet.

## unit 8 Present perfect 2 (I have done)
### situation
Dave: **Have** you **travelled** a lot, Jane?
Jane: Yes, I've been to lots of places.
Dave: Really? **Have** you ever **been** to China?
Jane: Yes, **I've been** to China twice.
Dave: What about India?
Jane: No, I **haven't been** to India.

When we talk about a period of time that continues from the past until not, we use the present perfect (**have been** / **have travelled etc**.). Here, Dave and Jane are taking about the places Jane has visited in her life, which is a period that continues until now.

**Been (to)** = visited:
- I'**ve** never **been to** China. Have you **been** there?

### In the following examples too, the speakers are talking about a period that continues until now (recently / in the last few days / so far / since breakfast etc)
- **Have** you **heard** anything from Brian **recently**?
- I'**ve met** a lot of people **in the last few days**.
- Everything is going well. We **haven't had** any problems **so far**.
- I'm hungry. I **haven't eaten** anything **since breakfast**.
- It's good to see you again. We **haven't seen** each other **for a long time**.

### we use present perfect with **today / this evening / this year etc. when these periods are not finished at the time of speaking
- I'**ve drunk** four cups of coffee today.
- **Have** you **had** a holiday **this year**?
- I **haven't seen** Tom this morning. Have you?
- Rob **hasn't worked** very hard **this term**.

### We say. It's the (first) time something **has happened**.
- Don is having a driving lesson. It's his first one.
- It's the first time he **has driven** a car.
- He **has never driven** a car before.
- Sarah has lost her passport again. This is the second time this **has happened**.

## unit 9 Present perfect continuous (I have been doing)
### It has been raining situation
Is it raining?
No, but the ground is wet.
**It has been raining.**

> **Have/has been -ing** is the present perfect continuous

### We use the present perfect continuous for an activity that has recently stopped or just stopped. There is connection with now
- You're out of breath. **Have** you **been running**? (= you're out of breath now)
- Paul is very tired. He's been working very hard. (= he's tired now)
- Where have you been? I'**ve been looking** for you everywhere.

### It has been raining for two hours. situation
It began raining two hours ago and it is still raining.
How long **has** it **been raining**?
It **has been raining** for two hours.

> We use the present perfect continuous in this way especially with **how long**, **for**... and **since**... . The activity is still happening (as in this example) or has just stopped.

- **How long have** you **been learning** English? (= you're still learning English)
- Tim is still watching TV. He'**s been watching** TV **all day**.

### Compare I am doing and I have been doing

## unit 10 Present perfect continuous and simple
### situation
#### Present perfect continuous
There is paint on Kate's clothes.
She **has been painting** her bedroom.

**Has been painting** is the present perfect continuous.

We are thinking of the activity. It does not matter whether it has been finished or not. In this example, the activity (painting the bedroom) has not been finished.

- My hands are very dirty. I've been repairing my bike.
- Joe has been eating too much recently. He should eat less.
- It's nice to see you again. What **have** you **been doing** since we last met?
- Where have you been? **Have** you **been playing** tennis? 
#### present perfect
Her bedroom was green. Now it is yellow.
She **has painted** her bedroom.

**Has painted** is the present perfect simple

Here, the important thing is that something has been finished. **Has painted** is a completed action. We are interested in the result of the activity (the painted bedroom), not the activity itself.

- My bike is OK again now. I'**ve repaired** it.
- Somebody **has eaten** all the chocolates. The box is empty.

- Lisa is writing emails. She'**s sent** lots of emails this morning.
- They'**ve played** tennis three times this week.

> But note that you can use **want** and **mean** in the present perfect continuous

- It'**s been raining since lunchtime**.

### You can use either the presen perfect continuous or simple with live and work

- How long **have** you **been working/ have** you **worked** here?

#### But use the simple with always

- I **haven't seen** Tome since Monday. (= Monday was the last time I saw him)

It is possible to leave out **for** (but not usually in negative sentences)

- I haven't seen Tom **since Monday**.

## unit 13 Present perfect and past 1 (I have done and I did)
### situation
Tom is looking for his key. He can't find it.
He **has lost** his key.
This means that he doesn't have his key now.

Ten minutes later:
Now Tom **has found** his key. He has it now.
**Has** he **lost** his key? No, he **has found** it.
**Did** he **lose** his key? Yes, he did.

He **lost** his key but now he **has found** it.

#### explain
The present perfect (something **has happened**) is a present tense. It always tells us about the situation now. Tom **has lost** his key = he doesn't have his key now.

The past simple (something **happened**) tells us only about the past. If somebody says Tom **lost** his key, this doesn't tell us whether he has the key now or not. It tells us only that he lost his key at some time in the past.

### Don't use the present perfect if the situation now is different.
- They'**ve gone** away. They'll be back on Friday. (they are away now)
- They **went** away,but I think they're back at home now. (not They've gone)
- It **has stopped** raining now, so we don't need the umbrella. (it isn't raining now)
- It **stopped** raining for a while, but now it's raining again. (not it has stopped)

### You can use the present perfect for new or recent happenings
- I'**ve repaired** the washing machine. It's working OK now.
- Sally **has had** a baby! It's a boy.

### Use the past simple for things that are not recent or new

- My mother **grew** up in Italy.

#### Compare
- Did you know that somebody **has invented** a new type of washing machine?

### We use present perfect to five new information. But if we continue to talk about it. we normaaly use the past simple

B: How **did** you **do** that?
A: I **picked** up a hot dish.

A: Look! Somebody **has split** something on the sofa.
