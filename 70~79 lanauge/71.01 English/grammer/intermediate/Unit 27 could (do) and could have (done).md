# Unit 27 could (do) and could have (done)
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
Sometimes **could** is the past of **can**
- Listen. I **can hear** something. (now)
- I listened. I **could hear** something. (past)

But **could** is not always past. We also use **could for possible actions now or in the future, expecially to make suggestions**.

**Can** is also possible in these sentences ('We can go to the cinema.' etc.). **Could** is less sure than **can**.

## Part B
We also use **could** (not **can**) for actions that are not realistic.
- I'm so tired, I **could sleep** for a week. (not I can sleep for a week)

Compare **can** and **could**:
- I **can stay** with Sarah when I go to Paris. (realistic)
- Maybe I **could stay** with Sarah when I go to Paris. (possible, but less sure)
- This is a wonderful place. I **could stay** here for ever.

## Part C
We also use **could** (not **can**) to say that something is `possible now or in the future`:
- The story **could be** true, but I don't think it is. (not can be true)
- I don't know what time Lisa is coming. She **could get** here at any time.

Compare **can** and **could**:
- The weather **can** change very quickly in the mountains. (in general)
- The weather is nice now, but it **could** change later. (the weatehr now, not in general)

## Part D
We use **could have** (done) to `talk about the past`.

Something **could have** happened = it was passible, but did not happen

## Part E
**I couldn't do** something = `it would not be possible`:
- I **couldn't live** in a big city. I'd hate it. (= it wouldn't be possible for me)

For the past we use **couldn't have**... (= would not have been possible)
