# Unit 18 used to (do)
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A 
### situation
Nicola doesn't travel much these days.
She prefers to stay at home.

But she **used to travel** a lot.
She **used to go** away two or three times a year.

She **used to travel** a lot = she travelled often in the past, but she doesn't do this any more.

## Part B
I **used to** do something = I did it often in the past, but not any more:
- I **used to play** tennis a lot, but I don't play very much now.
- David **used to spend** a lot of money on clothes. These days he can't afford it.

We also use **used to**... for things that were true, but are not true any more:
- This building is now a furniture shop. It **used to be** a cinema.
- I **used to think** Mark was unfriendly, but now I realise he's a very nice person.
- I've started drinking coffee recently. I never **used to like** it before.

## Part C
**I used to** do something is past. There is no present. You cannot say I use to do'
To talk about the present, we use present simple (**I do**)

Compare:
<table>
      <tbody>
          <tr>
              <td>past</td>
              <td>he **used to play**</td>
              <td>we **used to live**</td>
              <td>there **used to be**</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>he **plays**</td>
              <td>we **live**</td>
              <td>there **is**</td>
          </tr>
      </tbody>
</table>

- We **used to live** in a small village, but now we **live** in a city.
- There **used to be** four cinemas in the town. Now there **is** only one.

## Part D 
The normal question form is **did** (you) **use to**...?:
- **Did** you **use to eat** a lot of sweets when you were a child? (= did you do this often)

The negative form is **didn't use to** ... (**used not to** ... is also possible):
- I **didn't use to like** him. (or I **used to like** him.)

## Part E
Compare **I used to do** and **I was doing**:
- I **used to watch** TV a lot. (= I watched TV often in the past, but I don't do this any more)
- I **was watching** TV when Rob called. (= I was in the middle of watching TV)

## Part F
Do not confuse **I used to do** and **I am used to doing** (see Unit 61). The structures and meanings are different:
- I **used to live** alone. (= I lived alone in the past, but I no longer live alone)
- **I am used to living** alone. (= I live alone, and it's not a problem for me because I've lived alone for some time.)
