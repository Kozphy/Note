# Unit 46 have something done
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A situation
The roof of Lisa's house was damaged.

So she called a builder, and yesterday he came and repaired it.

Lisa **had** the roof **repaired** yesterday.

This means: Lisa arranged for somebody else to repair the roof. She didn't repair it herself

If you **have something done**, you arrange for somebody to do it for you.

Compare:
- Lisa **repaired** the roof. (= she repaired it herself)
- Lisa **had** the roof **repaired**. (= she arranged for somebody else to repair it)
- A: Did you **make** those curtains yourself?
    - B: Yes, I like making things
- A: Did you **have** those curtains **made**?
    - B: No, I made them myself.


## Part B
|have|object|p.p|
|---|---|---|
|Lisa **had**| the roof| **repaired**|
|Where did you **have**| your hair| **cut**?|
|We are **having**| the house | **painted**.|
|I think you should **have**| that coat | cleaned. |
| I don't like **having** | my picture | **taken** |

## Part C get something done
You can say '**get** something done' instead of '**have something done**':
- When are you going to **get the roof repaired**? (=have the roof repaired)
- I think you should **get your hair cut** really short.

## have something done with different meaning
We also use **have something done** with a different meaning.
- Paul and Karen **had their bags stolen** while they were travelling.

This does not mean that they arranged for somebody to steal their bags. They **had their bags stolen**. means only: 'Their bags were stolen'

With this meaning, we use **have something done** to say that something happens to somebody or their belongings:
- Gary **had** his nose **broken** in a fight. (= his nose was broken)
- Have you ever **had** your bike **stolen**?
