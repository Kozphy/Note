# Unit 22 will and shall 2
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
We do not use **will** to say what somebody has already arranged or decided to do.

We use **will** to say what we know or believe about the future (not what someone has already decided)


When we predict a future happening or situation, we use **will/won't**

Compare:
- I think James **is going** to the party on Friday. (= I think he has already decided to go)
- I think James **will go** to the party on Friday. (= I think he will decided to go)

## Part B
We often use **will ('ll)** with:
- probably
- I'm sure
- I think
- I don't think
- I wonder

After **I hope**, we generally use the present

## Part C
Generally we use **will** to talk about the future, but sometimes we use **will** to talk about now:
- Don't phone Amy now. She'**ll be** busy. (= she'll be busy now)

## Part D
Normally we use **shall** only with **I** and **we**.
You can say:
- **I shall** or **I will (I'll)**
- **we shall** or **we will (we'll)**

The negative of **shall** is **shall not** or **shan't**:
- I **shan't** be here tomorrow. (or I **won't** be)

We do not normally use **shall** with **he/she/it/you/they**:
- She **will** be very angry. (not She shall be)
