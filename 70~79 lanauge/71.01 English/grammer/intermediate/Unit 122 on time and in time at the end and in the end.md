# Unit 122 **on time** and **in time** **at the end** and **in the end**
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A **on time** and **in time**
**on time** = punctual, not late
If something happens **on time**, **it happens at the time that was planned**:
- The 11.45 train left **on time**. (= it left at 11.45)
- Please be **on time**. Don't be late.

**in time** (for something / to do something) = soon enough
- Will you be home **in time for dinner**? (= soon enough for dinner)
- I sent Amy a birthday present. I hope it arrives **in time**. (= on or before her birthday)


The opposite of **in time** is **to late**:
- I got home **to late** to watch the game on TV.

You can say **just in time** (= almost too late):
- We got to the station **just in time** for our train.
- A child ran into the road in front of the car, but I managed to stop **just in time**.

## Part B **at the end** and **in the end**
**at the end** (of something) = **at the time when something ends**
for ex:
at the end of the month
at the end of January
at the end of the game
at the end of the film
at the end of the course
at the end of the concert

- I'm going away **at the end of January / at the end of the month**. 
- **At the end of the concert**, everyone applauded.

We do not say "**in** the end of..." For ex, we do not say "in the end of January".

The opposite of **at the end** is **at the beginning**:
- I'm going away **at the beginning of January**. (not in the beginning)

**in the end** = finally
We use **in the end** when we say what the final result of a situation was:
- We had a lot of problems with our car. We sold it **in the end**. (= finally we sold it)
- He got more and more angry. **In the end** he just walked out of the rooom.

The opposite of **in the end** is **at first**:
- **At first** we didn't get on very well, but **in the end** we became good friends.
