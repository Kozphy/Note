# Unit 109 Word order 1: verb + object; place and time
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A Verb + obj
The verb and the object normally go together. We do not usually put other words between them:
|     | verb     | object     |                                   |
| --- | -------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| I   | **like** | **my job** | very much. (not I like very much) |
| Our guide      | **spoke**          | **English**           | fluently. (not spoke fluently English)                        |

Two more example:
- I lost all my money and I also **lost my passport**. (not I lost also my passport)
- At the end of this street you'll **see a supermarket** on your left. (not see on your left a supermarket)

## Part B Place
The verb and place (where?) normally go together:
- go home
- live in a city
- walk to work

if the verb has an object, the order is:
|         | verb      | object           | place                                               |
| ------- | --------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| We      | **took**  | **the children** | **to the zoo.**  (not took to the zoo the children) |
| Don't   | **put**   | **anything**     | **on the table**.                                   |
| Did you | **learn** | **English**      | **at school**?                                      |

## Part C Time
Normally time (when? / how often? / how long?) goes after place:

|           | place        | time                                           |
| --------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Ben walks | **to work**  | **every morning**. (not every morning to work) |
| I'm going | **to Paris** | **on Monday**.                                 |
| They've lived          | **in the same house**             | **for a long time**.                                               |

Sometimes we put time at the beginning of the sentence:
- **On Monday** I'm going to Pairs
- **After the party** Sarah gave me a lift home.

Some time words (for ex, **always/never/usually**) go with the verb in the middle of the sentence. See Unit 110.
