# Unit 23 I will and I'm going to
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A Future actions
- will
    - We use **will** (We'**ll** invite...) to announce a new decision.

- (be) going to (We'**re going to** invite...)
    - We use **(be) going to** when we have already decided to do something.

Compare:
- Gary has been trying to contact you. Has he? OK, I'**ll call** him.
- Gary has been trying to contact you. Yes, I know. I'**m going to call** him.

## Part B Future happenings and situations (predicting the future)
We use both **will** and **going to** for future happenings and situations.

When we say something **is going to** happen, we believe this because of the situation now. What is happening now shows that something **is going to** happen in the future.

Compare:
- We'**re going to be** late. The meeting starts in five minutes and it takes 15 minutes to get there. (It's clear now that we don't have enough time to get there)
- Jane **will be** late for the meeting. She's always late.(I believe this because I know what Jane is like)
