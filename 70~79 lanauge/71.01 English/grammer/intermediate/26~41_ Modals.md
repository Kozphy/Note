## Unit 25 Can could and (be) able to
### Part 1 can
We use **can** to say that something is possible or allowed, or that somebody has the ability to do something. We use **can** + infinitive (can do / can see etc.):
- We **can see** the lake from out hotel.
- I don't have a pen. You **can use** mine.
- **Can** you **speak** any foreign languages?

The negative is can't

### Part 2 is able to and can
You can say that somebody **is able to** do something, but can is more usual:
- We **are able to see** the lake from our hotel.

But **can** has only two forms: **can** and **could**. So sometimes it is necessary to use **(be) able to**. Compare:
- I can't sleep.
- I **haven't been able to** sleep recently.
- Tom can come tomorrow.
- Tom **might be able to** come tomorrow.
- Maria can speak French, Spanish and English.
- Applicants for the job **must be able to** speak two foreign languages.

### Part 3 Could
Sometimes **could** is the past of **can**. We use **could** especially with:
**see, hear, smell, taste, feel, remember, understand**
- We had a lovely room in the hotel. We **could see** the lake.
- As soon as I walked into the room, I **could smell** gas.
- I was sitting at the back of the theatre and **couldn't hear** very well.

We also use **could** to say that somebody `had the general ability or permission to do something`
- My grandfather **could speak** five languages.
- We were totally free. We could do what we wanted. (= we were allowed to do)

### Part 4 Could and was able to
We use **could** for general ability. But if you want to say that somebody did something in a specific situation, use **was/were able to** or **managed to** (no **could**)
- The fire spread through the building very quickly, but fortunately everybody **was able to escape / managed to escape**.
- We didn't know where David was, but we **managed to find / were able to find** him in the end.

Compare
- Jack was an excellent tennis player when he was younger. He **could beat** anybody. (= he had the general ability to beat anybody)
- Jack and Andy played a match yesterday. Andy played well, but Jack **managed to beat** him. (= he managed to beat him this time)

The negative **couldn't (could not)** is possible in all situations.

## Unit 27 Could (do) and could have (done)
### Part 1 can and could
We use could in a number of ways. Sometimes **could** is the past of **can**:
- Listen. I can hear something.
- I listened. I could hear something.

But **could** is not only used in this way. We also use **could** to `talk about possible actions now or in the future` (especially to make suggestions). For ex:
- What shall we do tonight? We **could go** to the cinema.
- When you go to Paris next month, you **could stay** with Sarah. Yes, I suppose I **could**.

**Could** is less sure than **can**.

### Part 2 realistic of can and could
We also use **could** (not can) `for actions that are not realistc`.
- I'm so tired, I **could sleep** for a week.

Compare can and could:
- I can stay with Sarah when I go to Paris. (realistic)
- Maybe I **could stay** with Sarah when I go to Paris. (possible, but less sure)
- This is a wonderful place. I **could stay** here forever. (unrealistic)

### Part 3 could and might and may
We also use **could** (not can) to say that `something (a situation or a happening) is possible now or in the future`. THe meaning is similar to **might** or **may**
- The story **could be** ture, but I don't think it is.
- I don't know what time Lisa is coming. She **could get** here at any time.

Compare can and could
- The weather **can** change very quickly in the mountains. (in general)
- The weather is nice now, but it could change. (the weather now, not in general)

### Part 4 could have
We use **could have (done)** to talk about `past`. Compare
- I'm so tired, I **could sleep** for a week.
- I was so tired, I **could have slept** for a week.
- The situation is bad, but it **could be** worse.
- The situation was bad, but it **could have been** worse.

Something **could have** hapened = `it was possible but did not happen`
- Why did you stay at a hotel when you were in Paris? You **could have stayed** with Sarah.
- David was lucky. He **could have hurt** himself when he fell, but he's OK.

### Part 5 couldn't
We use **couldn't** to say that something `would not be possible`:
- I **couldn't live** in a big city. I'd hate it. (= it wouldn't be possible for me)
- Everything is fine right now. Things **couldn't be** better.

For the past we use **couldn't have (done)**:

- The trip was cancelled last week. Paul **couldn't have gone** anyway because he was ill. (= It would not have been possible for him to go)

    - He **may be** in his office. (= perhaps he is in his office)
    - He **might be haveing** lunch. (= perhaps he is having lunch)
    - Ask Ann. She **might know**. (= perhaps she knows)

- She **might** know. or She **may** know.

The negative forms are **may not** and **might not** (or mightn't)
- It may not be true. (= perhaps it isn't true)

structure:
I/you/he (etc.) + may / might + (not) +

structure:
I/you/he (etc.) + may / might + (not) have +
- been (asleep / at home etc.)
- been (doing / working / feeling etc.)

### Could and may and might
Could is similar to may and might:
- It's a strange story, but it could be true. (= It is possible that it's true)
- You **could have left** your phone at work. (= it's possible that you left it there)

But **couldn't** is different from **may not** and **might not**. Compare
- Sarah **couldn't have** got my message. Otherwise she would have replied. (= it is not possible that she got my message)
- I wonder why Sarah hasn't replied to my message. I suppose she **might not have** got it. (= it's possible that she didn't get it - so perhaps she did, perhaps she didn't)

## Unit 30 May and might 2
### Part 1 may and might in the future
We use **may** and **might** to talk about `possible actions or happenings in the future`.
- I haven't decided yet where to go on holiday. I **may go** to Ireland. (= perhaps I will go there)
- Take an umbrella with you. It **might rain** latar. (= perhaps it will rain)
- The bus isn't always on time. We **might have** to wait a few minutes. (= perhaps we will have to wait)

Compare will and may/might:
- I'**ll** be late this evening (for sure)
- I **may/might** be late this evening. (possible)

### Part 2 might use in not real
Usually you can use may or might. So you can say:
- I **may go** to Ireland. or I **might go** to Ireland.
- Jane **might be** able to help you. or Jane **may be** able to help you.

But we use only **might** when the situation is not real.
- If they paid me better, I **might** work harder.

The situation here is not read because they do not pay me well, so I'm not going to work harder.

### Part 3 may/might be -ing
There is continuous form: **may/ might be - ing**. Compare this with **will be -ing**:
- Don't phone at 8.30. I' **ll be watching** the football on television.
- Don't phone at 8.30. I **might be watching** (or **I may be watching**) the football on TV. (= perhaps I'll be watching it)

We also use **may/might be -ing** for possible plans. Compare
- I'**m going** to Ireland in July. (for sure)
- I **might be going( or may be going)** to Ireland soon. (possible)

### Part 4 Might as well
Helen and Clare have just missed the bus. The buses run every hour.
- What shall we do? Shall we walk? We **might as well**. It's a nice day and I don't want to wait here for an hour.

We **might as well** do something = `We should do it because there no better alternative`. There is not reason not to do it.

**May as well** is also possible

- What time are you going out? Well, I'm ready, so I **might as well go** now.

- You can't turn right here. You **have to turn** left.

You can say **I'll have to..., I'm going to have to...** and **I might/ I may have to...**:
- They can't fix my computer, so I'**ll have to buy** a new one. or I'**m going to have to buy** a new one.
- Tom **might have to work** late tomorrow. or Tom **may have to work**... (= it's possible that he will have to)

### Part 2 Must and have to
You can use **must** or **have to** to give your own opinion (for example, to say what you think is necessary, or to recommend someone to do something)
- I haven't spoken to Sue for ages. I **must phone** her. / I **have to phone** her. (= I say this is necessary)
- Mark is a realy nice person. You **must meet** him. / You **have to meet** him. (I recommend this)

We use **have to (mot usually must)** to say what someone is obliged to do. The speaker is not giving **his/her** own opinion:
- I **have to work** from 8.30 to 5.30 every day. (a fact, not an opinion)
- Jane **has to travel** a lot for her work.

But **must** is used in written rules and instuctions:
- Applications for the job **must be received** by 18 May.
- (exam instruction) Answer all the questions. You **must write** your answer in ink.

You cannot use **must** to talk about the past:
- We didn't have much time. We **had** to hurry. (not we must hurry).

### Part 3 Mustn't and don't have to are completely different
You **mustn't** do something = it is necessary that you do not do it (so don't do it):
- You **must keep** this a secret. You **mustn't tell** anymore. (= don't tell anymore)
- I promised I would be on time. I **mustn't be** late. (= I must be on time)

You **don't have to** do something = you don't need to do it (but you can if you want)
- You **don't have to tell** Tom what happened. I can tell him myself.
- I **don't have to be** at the meeting, but I think I'll go anyway.

### Part 4 You can use have got to instead of have to.
- I've got to work tomorrow. or I **have to** work tomorrow.
- When **has** Helen **got to** go? or When **does** Helen **have to** go?

## Unit 32 Must mustn't needn't

You **must** do something = it is necessary that you do it:
- Don't tell anybody what I said. You **must** keep it a secret.

### Part 2 Needn't and don't need to

- We've got plenty of time. We **needn't hurry**. (= it is not necessary to hurry)
- Joe can stay here. He **needn't come** with us. (= it is not necessary for him to come)

You can also use **don't/doesn't need to**:
- We **don't need to** hurry.

Remember that we say **don't need to do/ doesn't need to do**, but **needn't do** (without to)

### Part 3 Needn't have
#### situation
Paul and Sue decided to go to a restaurant. They reserved a table.
Later =>
But the restarant was almost empty So they **needn't have reserved** a table.
- Hello, can I reserve a table for two, please? => We **needn't have reserved** a table.

Compare **needn't** (do) and **needn't have** (done):
- Everything will be OK. You **needn't worry**. (it is not necessary)
- Everything was OK. You **needn't have worried**. (you worried, but i was not necessary)

### Part 4 Needn't have (done) and didn't need to (do)
He **needn't have done** something = `he did it, but now we know that it was not necessary`.
- Why did he get up at 5 o'clock? He **needn't have got** up so early. He could have stayed in bed longer.

He **didn't need to** do something = `it was not necessary to do it. It doesn't matter whether he did it or not`.
- He **didn't need to** get up early, so he didn't
- He **didn't need to** get up early, but it was a beautiful morning, so he did.

**He didn't have to**... is also possible in these examples.

## Unit 33 Should 1
### Part 1 should do
You **should do** something = `it is a good thing to do or the right thing to do`. You can use **should** to give advice or to give an opinion:
- You look tired. You **should go** to bed.
- **Should** we **invite** Stephanie to the party? Yes, I think we **should**.

We often use **should** with **I think/ I don't think / Do you think**...?
- I **think** the government **should do** more to improve education.
- I **don't think** you **should work** so hard.
- **Do you think** I **should apply** for this job? Yes, **I think you should.

You **shouldn't** do something = `it isn't a good thing to do`:
- You **shouldn't believe** everything you read in the newspapers.

**Should** is not as strong as **must** or **have to**
- You **should** apologise. (= it would be a good thing to do)
- You **must** apologise. / You **have to** apologise. (= you have no alternative.)

### Part 2 should in some situation
You can use **should** when `something is not right or what you expect`:
- Where's Tina? She **should be** here by now. (= she isn't here yet, and this is not normal)
- The price on this packet is wrong. It **should be** $2.50, not $3.50.
- That man on the motorbike **should be wearing** a helmet.

We also use **should** to say that `we expect something to happen`:
- Helen has been studying hard for the exam, so she **should pass**. (= I expect her to pass)
- There are plenty of hotels in the town. It **shouldn't be** hard to find a place to stay. (= I don't expect it to be hard)

### Part 3 should have done
You **should have done** something = `you didn't do it, but it would have been the right thing to do`:
- You missed a great party last night. You **should have come**. Why didn't you? (= you didn't come, but it would have been good to come)
- I wonder why they're so late. They **should have got** here long ago.

- I'm feeling sick. I **shouldn't have eaten so much. (= I ate too much)
- She **shouldn't have been listening** to our conversation. It was private. (= she was listening)

Compare **should (do)** and **should have (done)**:
- You look tired. You **should go** to bed now.
- You went ot bed very late last night. You **should have gone** to bed earlier.

### Part 4 Ought to...
You can use **ought to** instead of **should** in the sentences on this page. We say **ought to do** (with do)

- Jack **ought not to go** to bed so late. (= Jack **shouldn't go**...)
- It was a great party last night. You **ought to have come**.
- Helen has been studying hard for the exam, so she **ought to pass**.

## Unit 34 Should 2
### section A You can use should after some verb
You can use **should** after:
insist, recommened, suggest, demand, propose
- I **insisted** that he **should apologise**. 
- Doctors **recommend** that everyone **should eat** plenty of fruit.
- What do you **suggest** we **should do**?
- Many people are **demanding** that something **should be done** about the problem.

It's important/vital/necessary/essential that ... should ...:
- It's **essential** that everyone **should be** here on time.

### Part B more about should 
You can also leave out should in the sentences in section A. So you can say
- It's essential that everyone be here on time. (= ...that everyone should be here)
- I **insisted** that he **apologise**. (= ... that he should apologize)
- What do you **suggest** we **do**?
- Many people are **demanding** that something **be done** about the problem.

This form (be/do/apologise etc.) is called the subjunctive. It is the same as the infinitive (without to), You an also use normal present and past tenses:
- It'**s essential** that everyone is here on time.
- I **insisted** that he **apologised**.

### Part C suggest
After **suggest**, you cannot use to ... (to do/ to buy etc). You can say
- What do you **suggest we should do**? or What do you **suggest we do**? (but not What do you suggest us to do?)
- Jane won the lottery.
    - I **suggested** that she **should buy** a car with the money she'd won.
    - I **suggested** that she **buy** a car.
    - I **suggested** that she **bought** a car. (but not I suggested her to buy)

You can also use **-ing** after **suggest** (What do you **suggest doing**?)

### Part D more about should
You can use **should** after a number of adjectives, especially:
strange, odd, funny, typical, natural, interesting, suprised, surprising
- It's **strange** that he **should be** late. He's usually on time.
- I was **surprised** that he **should say** such a thing.

### Part E if and should
You can say **if something should happen...**. For ex:
- We have no jobs at present, but **if** the situation **should change**, we will contract you.

You can also begin with **should (Should something happen ...)**
- **Should** the situation **change**, we will contact you.

This means the same as **if the situation changes,...** With **should**, the speaker feels that the possibility is smaller.

### Part F use should give advice
You can use **I should.../ I shouldn't...** to give somebody advice.
- Shall I leave now? No, **I should wait** a bit.

Here, **I should wait** = I would wait if I were you, I advise you to wait. more ex:
- I'm going out now. Is it cold out? Yes, **I should wear** a coat.
- I **shouldn't stay** up too late. You have to be up early tomorrow.

## Unit 35 Had better, It's time...
### Part A Had better (I'd better / you'd better etc.)
**I'd better do** something = it is advisable to do it. if I don't do it, there will be a problem or a danger.
- I have to meet Amy in ten minutes. **I'd better go** now or I'll be late.
- Shall I take an umbrella? Yes, **you'd better**. it might rain.
- **We'd better stop** for petrol soon. The tank is almost empty.

The negative is **I'd better not** (= I **had** better not):
- You don't look very well. **You'd better not go** out tonight.


Remember that:
The form is '**had** better' (usually I'd better / you'd better etc. in spoken English)
- I'**d better** phone Chris, **hadn't I**?

**Had** is normally past, but the meaning of **had better** is present or future, not past
- I'**d better go** to the bank **now / tomorrow**.

We say I'd better **do** (not to do):
- It might rain. We'd better **take** an umbrella. (not We'd better to take)


### Part B Had better and should
**Had better** is similar to **should**, but not exactly the same. We use **had better** only for a specific situation, not for things in general. You can use **should** in all types of situations to give an opinion or give advice:
- It's late. You'**d better go**. / You **should go**. (a specific situation)
- You're always at home. You **should go** out more often. (in general - not had better go)

Also, with **had better**, there is always a danger or a problem if you don't follow the advice. **Should** means only "it is a good thing to do" Compare:
- It's a great film. You **should** go and see it. (but not problem if you don't)
- The film starts at 8.30. You'**d better** go now or you'll be late.

### Part C It's time...
You can say **It's time** (for somebody) to ...:
- It's time **to go** home. / It's time for us **to go** home.

But you can also say:
- It's late. It's time **we went** home.

When we use **it's time** + past (we **went**/ I **did** / they **were** etc.), the meaning is present, not past.
- **It's time** they **were** here. Why are they so late? (not It's time they are here)

**It's time** somebody **did** something = they should have already done it or started it. We often use this structure to criticise or to complain:
- This situation can't continue. **It's time** you **did** something about it.
- He's very selfish. **It's time** he **realised** that he isn't the most important person in the world.

You can also say **It's about time...**, This makes the criticism stronger:
- Jack is a great talker. But **it's about time** he **did** something instead of just talking.

## Unit 36 Would 
### Part A would and would have 
We use **would ('d) / wouldn't** when we imagine a situation or action (= we think of something that is not real):
- It **would be** nice to buy a new car, but we can't afford it.
- I'**d love** to live by the sea.
- A: Shall I tell Chris what happened? B: No, I **wouldn't say** anything. (= I wouldn't say anything in your situation)

We use **would have (done)** when we imagine situations or actions in the past (= things that didn't happen):
- They helped us a lot. I don't know what we'**d have done**. (= we **would have done**) without their help.
- I didn't tell Sam what happened. He **wouldn't have been** pleased.

Compare **would (do)** and **would have (done)**:
- I **would call** Lisa, but I don't have her number. (now)
- I **would have called** Lisa, but I didn't have her number. (past)

We often use **would** in sentences with **if** (see Units 38-40)
- I **would call** Lisa **if** I had her number.
- I **would have called** Lisa **if** I'd had her number.

### Part B will ('ll) and would ('d)
- I'**ll stay** a little longer. I've got plenty of time.
- I'**d stay** a little longer, but I really have to go now. (so I can't stay longer)

Sometimes **would/wouldn't** is the past of **will/won't.** Compare:
- present
    - I'**ll call** you on Sunday. 
    - I promise I **won't be** late.
    - Damn! The car **won't start**.
- past
    - Tom said he'**d call** me on Sunday.
    - Amy promised that she **wouldn't be** late.
    - Lisa was annoyed because her car **wouldn't start**.

Somebody **wouldn't do** something = he/she refused to do it:
- I tried to warn him, but he **wouldn't listen** to me. (= he refused to listen)
- The car **wouldn't start**. (= it refused to start)

### Part C would and used to
You can also use **would** to talk about things that happened regularly in the past:
- When we were children, we lived by the sea. In summer, if the weather was fine, we **would** all get up early and go for a swim. (= we did this regularly)
- Whenever Richard was angry, he **would** walk out of the room.

With this meaning, **would** is similar to **used to** (see Unit 18):
- Whenever Richard was angry, he **used to walk** out of the room.

## Unit 37 Can/Could/Would you...? etc. (Requests, offers, permission and invitations)
### Part A Asking people do things (requests)
We used **can** or **could** to ask people to do things:
- **Can you** wait a moment, please?
- **Could you** wait a moment, please?

Note that we say **Do you think** you **could**...? (not can):
- **Do you think you could** take me to the station?

We also use **will** and **would** to ask people to do things (but **can/could** are more usual):
- Helen, **will you** do me a favour?
- **Would you** please be quiet? I'm trying to concentrate.

### Part B Asking for things
To ask for something, we use **Can I have...?/ Could I have ...? or Can I get...?**:
- (in a shop) **Can I have** these postcards, please? or **Can I get** these postcards, please?
- (during a meal) **Could I have** the salt, please?

**May I have...?** is also possible:
- **May I have** these postcards, please?

### Part C Asking to do things
To ask to do something, we use **can, could** or **may**:
- (on the phone) Hello, **can I** speak to Steve, please?
- **Could I** use your phone? 
- **Do you think I could** borrow your bike?
- **May I** come in? Yes, please do.

**May** is more formal than **can** or **could**.

To ask to do something, you can also say **Do you mind if I...?** or **Is it all right / Is it OK if I...?**:
- **Do you mind if** I use you phone? Sure. Go ahead.
- **Is it all right if** I come in? Yes, of course?

### Part E Offering and inviting
To offer or to invite, we use **Would you like**...? (not Do you like):
- **Would you like** a cup of coffee? Yes, please.
- **Would you like** to eat with us tonight? I'd love to.

**I'd like...** is a polite way of saying what you want:
- (at a tourist information office) **I'd like** some information about hotels, please.
- (in a shop) **I'd like** to try on this jacket, please.

## Unit 38 if I do... ad If I did...
### Part A what is different with if + present and if + past
Lisa: Shall we go by bus or by train?
Jess: **If we go** by bus, it **will** be cheaper.
For Jess, it is possible that they will go by bus so she says:
**If** we **go** by bus, it **will** be...

Lisa and Jess decide to go by train. Later, Jess talks to Joe.
Joe: How are you going to travel?
Jess: We're going by train. **If we went** by bus, it **would** be cheaper, but the train is quicker.

Now Jess knows they are not going to travel by bus, so she says:
**If** we **went** by bus, it **would** be... (not if we go...)

**When we imagine something that will not happen, or we don't expect that it will happen**, we use **if** + past (**if** we **went**/ **if** there **was**/ **if** you **found** etc.).
But the meaning is not past:
- What would you do **if** you **won** a lot of money? (we don't really expect this to happen)
- **If** there **was** (or were) an election tomorrow, who would you vote for?

For **if... was/were**, see Unit 39C.

Compare **if I find** and **if I found**:
- I think I left my watch at your house. **If you find** it, can you call me?
- **If you found** a wallet in the street, what would you do with it?

### Part B would and if-part
We do not normally use **would** in the **if**-part of the sentence:
- I'd be very scared **if** somebody **pointed** a gun at me. (not if somebody would point)
- **If** we went by bus, it would be cheaper. (not if we would go)

But you can use **if ... would** when you ask somebody to do something:
- (from a formal letter) I would be grateful **if** you **would let** me know your decision as soon as possible.

### Part C could and might
In the other part of the sentence (not the **if**-part) we use **would('d) / wouldn't**:
- What **would** you **do** if you were bitten by a snake?
- I'm not going to bed yet. I'm not tired. If I went to bed now, I **wouldn't sleep**.
- **Would** you **mind** if I used your phone?

**Could** and **might** are also possible:
- If I won a lot of money, I **might buy** a house. (= it is possible that I would buy a house)
- If it stopped raining, we **could go** out. (= we would be able to go out)

## Unit 39 If I knew... and I wish I knew...
### Part A situation
Sarah wants to phone Paul, but she can't do this because
she doesn't know his number. She says:

**If I knew** his number, I **would phone** him.

Sarah says: **If I knew** his number... . This tells us that she doesn't know his number. She is imagining the situation.
The real situation is that she doesn't know his number.

When we imagine a situation like this, we use **if** + past (**if** I **knew**/ **if** you **were**/ **if** we **didn't** etc).
But the meaning is present, not past:
- There are many things I'd like to do **if** I **had** more time. (but I don't have time)
- **If** I **didn't** want to go the party, I wouldn't go. (but I want to go)

### Part B wish
We use the past in the same way after **wish (I wish I knew/ I wish you were etc)**. We use **wish** to say that we regret something, that something is not as we would like it to be:
- I **wish** I **knew** Paul's phone number. (= I don't know it and regret this)
- Do you ever **wish** you **could** fly? (you can't fly)
- It rains a lot here. I **wish** it **didn't** rain so much.

### Part C If I were / if I was
After **if** and **wish**, you can use **were** instead of **was** (if I were/ I wish it were etc).
**If I was/ I wish it was** are also possible. So you can say:
- **If I were** you, I wouldn't buy that coat. or if I was you,...
- I'd go for a walk **if it weren't** so cold. or ...if it wasn't so cold.
- I **wish she were** here. or I wish she was here.

### Part D would 
We do not normally use **would** in the **if**-part of the sentence or after **wish**:
- **If** I **were** rich, I **would** travel a lot. (not If I would be rich)
- Who **would** you ask **if** you **needed** help? (not if you would need)
- I **wish** I **had** something to read. (not I wish I would have)

Sometimes **wish ... would** is possible: **I wish you would listen**. See Unit 41.

### Part E Could
**Could** sometimes means "would be able to" and sometimes "was/were able to"
- She **could** get a better job if she **could** speak English. (she could get = she would able to get)
- I wish I **could** help you. (I wish I could = I wish I was able)

## Unit 40 If I had known..., I wish I had known ...
### Part A if + had known/been/done etc
Last month Gary was in hospital for a few days. Rachel didn't know this, so she didn't go to visit him. They met a few days ago.
Rachel said:
**if I'd known** you were in hospital, I **would have gone** to see you.

Rachel said: **If I'd known**(= if I **had** known) you were in hospital. This tells us that she didn't know

We use **if + had ('d)**... to talk about the past (if I had known/been/done etc):
- I didn't see you passed me in the street. **If** I'**d seen** you, of course I would have said hello. (but I didn't see you)
- I didn't go out last night. I would have gone out **if** I **hadn't been** so tired. (but I was tired)
- **If** he **had been looking** where he was going, he wouldn't have walked into the wall. (but he wasn't looking)

Compare:
- I'm not hungry. **If** I **was** hungry, I would eat something. (now)
- I wasn't hungry. **If** I **had been** hungry, I would have eaten something. (past)

### Part B if and would
Do not use **would** in the **if**-part of the sentence. We use **would** in the other part of the sentence
- **If** I **had seen** you, I **would have said** hello. (not If I would seen you)

Note that **'d** can be **would** or **had**:
- If I'**d seen** you. (I'd seen = I had seen)
- I'**d have said** hello. (I'**d** have said = I **would** have said)

### Part C had and wish
We use **had (done)** in the same way after **wish**. I **wish** something **had happened** = I am sorry that it didn't happen:
- I **wish** I'**d known** that Gary was ill. I would have gone to see him. (but I didn't know)
- I feel sick. I **wish** I **hadn't eaten** so much cake. (I ate too much cake)
- Do you **wish** you'**d studied** science instead of languages? (you didn't study science)

Do not use **would have ...** after **wish**:
- The weather was cold when we were on holiday. I wish it **had been** warmer. (not I wish it would have been)

### Part D 
Compare would (do) and would have (done)
- If I'd gone to the party last night, I **would be** tired now. (I am not tired now - present)
- If I'd gone to the party last night, I **would have met** lots of people. (I didn't meet lots of people - past)

Compare **would have**, **could have** and **might have**:
- if the weather hadn't been so bed,
    - we **would have gone** out.
    - we **could have gone** out. (= we would have been able to go out)
    - we **might have gone** out. (= perhaps we would have gone out)

## Unit 41 Wish
### Part A compare wish and hope
You can say '**I wish you luck / all the best / a happy birthday' etc.
- **I wish you all the best** in the future.
- I saw Mark before the exam and **he wished me luck**

We say 'wish somebody something'(**luck / a happy birthday** etc.). But you cannot say 'I wish that something happens'. We use **hope** in this situation. For ex:
- I'm sorry you're not well. I **hope** you **feel** better soon. (not I wish you feel)

Compare I **wish** and I **hope**:
- I **wish** you **a pleasant stay** here.
- I **hope** you **have** a pleasant stay here. (not I wish you have)

### Part B
We also use **wish** to say that we regret something, that something is not as we would like it.
When we use **wish** in this way, we use the past (**knew/lived** etc.), but the **meaning is present**:
- I **wish** I **knew** what to do about the problem. (I don't know and I regret this)
- I **wish** you **didn't** have to go so soon. (you have to go)
- Do you **wish** you **lived** near the sea? (you don't live near the sea)
- Jack's going on a trip to Mexico soon. I **wish** I was going too. (I'm not going)

To say that we regret something in the past, we use **wish + had...**(had known / had said) etc:
- I **wish** I'**d known** about the party. I would have gone if I'd known. (I didn't know)
- It was a stupid thing to say. I **wish** I **hadn't said** it. (I said it)

### Part C wish I could
I **wish I could** (**do** something) = I regret that I cannot do it:
- I'm sorry I have to go. I **wish** I **could stay** longer. (but I can't)
- I've met that man before. I **wish** I **could remember** his name. (but I can't)

I **wish I could have** (**done** something) = I reget that I could not do it:
- I hear the party was great. I **wish** I **could have gone**. (but I couldn't go)

### Part D wish (somebody) and would (do something).
You can say '**I wish** (somebody) **would** (do something)'. ex:
It's been raining all day. Tanya doesn't like it. She says:
I **wish** it **would stop** raining.

Tanya would like the rain to stop, but this will probably not happen.

We use **I wish ... would** when we would like something to happen or change. Usually, the speaker doesn't expect this to happen.

We often use **I wish ... would** to complain about a situation:
- The phone has been ringing for five minutes. **I wish** somebody **would answer** it.
- **I wish** you'**d do** (= you **would** do) something instead of just sitting and doing nothing.

You can use **I wish... wouldn't...** to complain about things that people do repeatedly:
- **I wish** you **wouldn't keep** interrupting me. (= please don't interrupt me)

We can use **I wish ... wouldn't ...** to say that we want something to happen. But we do not use **I wish...would...** to say how we would like things to be. Compare:
- I **wish** Sarah **would** come. (= I want her to come)
- I **wish** Sarah **was**(or **were**) here now. (not I wish Sarah would be)
- I **wish** somebody **would buy** me a car.
- I **wish** I **had** a car. (not I wish I would have)
