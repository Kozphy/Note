# Unit 94 Relative clauses 3: **whose/whom/where**
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A whose
example:
>When we were driving home, we saw some people standing by the road. Their car had broken down, so we stopped to help them.
>We helped some people **whose** car had broken down. (=**their** car had broken down)

We use **whose** mostly for people.

Compare **who** and **whose**:
- I met a man **who** knowns you. (**he** knowns you)
- I met a man **whose sister** knows you. (**his sister** knows you)

Do not confuse **whose** and **who's**. The pronunciation is the same, but **who's**= who **is** or who **has**

## Part B whom
**Whom** is possiblle instead of **who** when it is the object of the verb (see Unit 93B).

You can also use a preposition + **who (to whom/ from whom/ with whom** etc.)

**Whom** is a formal word and we do not often use it in spoken English. We usually prefer to say:
- **a person I admire** a lot or a person **who/that** I admire a lot.
- **friends you can relax with** or friends **who/that** you can relax with.

## Part C where
We use **where** in a relative clause to talk about a place:
- I recently went back to **the town where** I grew up. (I grew up **there**)

## Part D the day, the time, the reason
We say '**the day** we got married', ''**the year** I was born', '**the last** time they met' etc.

You can also use **that**.

We say '**the reason** I'm calling you', '**the reason** she didn't get the job' etc.

You can also use **that**.
