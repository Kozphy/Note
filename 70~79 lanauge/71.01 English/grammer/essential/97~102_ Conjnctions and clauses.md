###### tags: `engilsh grammerly essential`

## unit 97 and, but, or, so , because
### We use these words (conjunctions) to join two sentences. They make one longer sentence from two shorter sentences
- The car stopped and the driver got out.

### and/but/or
- We stayed at home and watched television.
- I bought a sandwich, but I didn't eat it.
- Do you want to go out, or are you too tired?

In lists, we use commas (,). We use and before the last thing
- I got hame, had something to eat, sat down in an armchair and fell asleep.
- Karen is at work, Sue has gone shopping and Chris is playing football.

### so (the result of something)
- It was very hot, so I opened the window.
- Joe does a lot of sport, sor he's very fit.

### bacause (the reason for something)
- I opened the window because it was very hot.

### Because is also possible at the beginning
- Because it was very hot, I opened the window.

### In these examples there is more than on conjunction
- It was late and I was tired, so I went to bed.
- I always enjoy visiting London, but I wouldn't like to live there because it's too big.

## unit 98 When...
### We write a comma if When... is at the beginning
- When you're tired, don't drive.
- Don't drive when you're tired.

### We do the same in sentences with before/while/after.
- Always look both ways before you cross the road.
- Before you cross the road, always look both ways.
- While I was waiting for the bus, it began to rain.
- It began to rain while I was waiting for the bus.
- He never played football again after he broke his leg
- After he broke his leg, he never played football again.

### When I am... / When I go etc
#### We use the present with a future meaning after when:
- **When** I **get** home this evening, I'm going to have a shower.
- I can't talk to you now. I'll talk to you later **when** I **have** more time.

#### We do the same after before/while/after/until
- Please close the window **before** you **go** out.
- Rachel is going to stay in our flat **while** we **are** away.
- I'll wait here **until** you **come** back.

## unit 99 if we go..., if you see... etc.
### if can be at the beginning of a sentence or in the middle
#### if at the beginning
- if we go by bus, it weill be cheaper.
- if you don't hurry, you'll miss the train.

#### if in the middle
- It will be cheapter if we go by bus.
- You'll miss the train if you don't hurry.

#### In conversation, we often use the if-part of the sentence alone
Are you going to the concert? Yes, if I can get a ticket.
if I'm late this evening, don't wait for me.
What shall we do if it rains?


### After if, we use the present. We say if you see...
- if you see Ann tomorrow, can you ask her to call me?

### if and when
#### if I go out = it is possible that I will go out, but I'm not sure
Are you going out later? Maybe. If I go out, I'll close the windows.

#### When I go out = I'm going out (for sure):
Are you going out later? Yes, I am. When I go out, I'll close the windows.

#### Compare when and if:
When I get home this evening, I'm going to have a shower.
If I'm late this evening, don't wait for me.
We're going to play tennis if it doesn't rain.
