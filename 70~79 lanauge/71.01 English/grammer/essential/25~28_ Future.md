###### tags: `engilsh grammerly essential`

## unit 25 What are you doing tomorrow?
We use **am/is/are + Ving** (present continuous) for something happening now:
- Where are Tina and Helen? **They're playing** tennis in the park.
- Please be quiet. I'm working.

We also use **am/is/are + Ving** for the future(tomorrow/ next week etc.)
- Andrew **is playing** tennis tomorrow.
- **I'm** not **working** next week.

**I am doing something tomorrow** = I have arranged to do it, I have a plan to do it:
- Sophie **is going** to the dentist on Friday.
- **We're having** a party next weekend.
- **Are** you **meeting** your friends tonight?
- What **are** you **doing** tomorrow evening?

Compare
- present continuous (usually for people)
    - I'm going to a concert tomorrow.
    - What time are you leaving?
- present simple (for timetables, programmes etc.)
    - The concert starts at 7.30.
    - What time does your train leave?

## unit 26 I'm going to ...
**I am going to do something** = I have decided to do it, my intention is to do it:
- I'm going to buy some books tomorrow.
- Sarah is going to sell her car.

We also use the present continuous for the future, usually for arrangements
- I am playing tennis with Julia tomorrow.

Something **is going to happen** = we can see now that it is sure to happen:
- Look at the sky! It's going to rain. (black clouds now -> rain)
- Oh dear! It's 9 o'clock and I'm not ready. I'm going to be late. (9 o'clock now and not ready -> late)

## unit 27 will/shall 1
will + infinitive
We use **will** for the future
- Sie travels a lot. Today she is in Madrid. Tomorrow she'll be in Rome. Next week she'll be in Tokyo.

We often say **I think...will...**:
- I think Kelly will pass the exam.
- I don't think it will rain this afternoon.

We do not use **will** for things we **have already arranged or decided to do**
- We're going to the cinema on Saturday. Do you want to come with us?
- I'm not working tomorrow.
- Are you going to do the exam?

**shall**
You can say **I shall** and **we shall**:
- **I shall be** late tomorrow. = I will be late tomorrow.
- I think **we shall win**. = I think we will win.

But do not use **shall** with **you/they/he/she/it**:
- **Tom will** be late.

## unit 28 will/shall 2
You can use **I'll** when you offer something or decide to do something:
- My bag is very heavy. **I'll carry** it for you.


We often say **I think I'll.../I don't think I'll** when we decide to do something:
- I'm tired. I **think I'll go** to bed early tonight.
- It's a nice day. **I think I'll sit** outside.

Do not use the present simple (I go/ I phone etc.) in sentences like these:
- I'll phone you tomorrow, OK?
- I think I'll go to bed early.

Do not use I'll.. for something you decided before:
- I'm working tomorrow.
- I don't want my car any more. I'm going to sell it.
- What are you doing at the weekend?

**Shall I ...? Shall we... ?** = Do you think this is a good thing to do? Do you think this is a good idea?
- It's very warm in this room. Shall I open the window?
- Shall I phone you this evening? Yes,please.
- I'm going to a party tonight. What shall I wear?
