## Unit 10 Describing appearance
### Part A Describing beauty
Your **appearance** is the way you look, and we sometimes use different words to talk about **beauty** in men and women.

Women can be **attractive** or good-looking, and we often use **pretty**. to describe a girl. We use beautiful or **gorgeous** for women who are very attractive.

Men can be attractive and good-looking, but also handsome. **If men are very attractive, we can say they are gorgeous or very good-looking, but not usually beautiful**.

> ### Language help
> The opposite of beautiful is ugly, but it is not very polite to describe someone as ugly; **ordinary** is more polite. It also isn't polite to say that someone is fat; **overweight** is more polite.

### Part B Size
We can talk about a person's height and their weight, e.g. I'm **roughly**(about; syn **approximately**) one metre eighty (tall), and I **weigh** just under eighty kilograms.

If someone is not tall or short, you can describe them as **medium height**.

If a person is very similar to most other people in height and weight, you can say they are **average**.

A: How tall is Hannah? 
B: **Medium height**, I'd say.

A: Is Marco quite big?
B: No, about **average**.

### Part C Hair

    - blonde or blond
    - fair
    - brown
    - dark
    - black
- hair shape
    - straight
    - wavy
    - curly
### Part D Talking about someone's appearance
A: Is he tall?
B: Er,**tallish** \[quite tall\], but he's got **broad** shoulders \[wide; opp **narrow**\]. He looks very **athletic** \[strong,healthy and often good at sports\]. I think he does a lot of sport.
A: Is he quite **smart** \[clean, tidy and stylish\]
B: Yeah, he **dresses** quite **well** \[the clothes he wears are quite nice\].

> Language help
> We can use the suffix **-ish** at the end of some adjectives to mean 'quite', e.g. She's got **longish** hair, and at the end of some numbers to mean 'more or less', e.g. He's **twentyish**.

## Unit 12 Feelings
### Part A How do you feel?
> Language help
> We use **emotion** and **feeling(s)** for something which someone feels strongly about, e.g. love, hate or anger. Emotions are part of our character, e.g. Timo is a very emotional person.(shows his feelings easily)
**Feeling** is often plural, e.g. She doesn't like talking about her **feelings**.

### Part B The effect of the weather on our feelings
Why do people say they feel more **cheerful**(happy) when sun shines, and **miserable**(unhappy) when it's raining? Why do some people suffer from **SAD (seasonal affective disorder)**, which makes them feel **depressed**(unhappy, often for a long time, and without hope for the future) during long dark winters? Can the weather really affect our **mood**(the way we feel at a particular time), or is it just in out imaginations?


### Part C The effect of colour on our emotions
colour can have an **effect** on our mood, but how do specific colours relate to our emotions?

Pink though, is softer and more about maternal love and **caring for** people.

green is associated with nature and is good for people suffering from **stress**.

Blue is relaxing and helps us to be **creative**. but too much dark blue can make us depressed.

red can make us feel **energetic**, but it can also indicate **anger**.

energetic: wanting to be busy and doing a lot of things.

anger: being angry

caring for: looking after someone, expecially someone young or old.

stress: feelings of worry by difficult situations such as problems at work

creative: good at thinking of new ideas or using our imagination.

## Unit 13 Family and friends
### Part A Relatives
My father died when I was nine, and so my mother was a **widow** with four young children. She **remarried** five years later, so now I have a **stepfather**. As he is not my real father, I call him by his first name, which is Dieter. I've got an **elder** brother called Thomas and two younger sisters Anya and Claudia, who are **twins**. We're a **close family**.

My mother is an **only child**, but I've got two uncles on my father's side. One is married with two children, and the otehr is married with three children, so **altogether** I have five **cousins**. I **get on well with** Uncle Rolf, and hw always tells me I'm his favourite **newphew**. Of his **nieces**, I think he likes Anya best.

Recently my brother thomas **got married**. His wife's name is Sabine, so I now have a **sister-in-law*** as well.

### Part B Friends
My **best friend** is Florian, an old school friend. We **got to know each other** when we were in teh same class at school.
