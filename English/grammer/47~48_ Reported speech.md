# 47~48: Reported speech
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Unit 47 Reported speech 1 (He said that ...)
### Part A situation
You want to tell somebody what Paul said.
There are two ways of doing this:

You can repeat Paul's words (direct speech):
Paul said "**I'm feeling ill**"

Or you can use reported speech:
Paul said **that he was feeling ill**.

Compare:
- direct
    - Paul said 'I am feeling ill.'
- reported
    - Paul said that **he was** feeling ill.

> In writing we use these quotation marks to show direct speech.

### Part B
When we use reported speech, the main verb of the sentence is usually past (Paul **said** that .../ I **told** her that ...etc.). The rest of the sentence is usually past too:
- Paul **said** that he **was feeling** ill.
- I **told** Lisa that I **didn't have** any money.

You can leave out **that**. So you can say:
- Paul **said that** he was feeling ill.
- Paul **said** he was feeling ill.

In general, the present form in direct speech changes to the past form in reported speech:
- am/is --> was
- do/does --> did
- will --> would
- are --> were
- have/has --> had
- can --> could
- want/like/know/go etc. --> wanted/liked/knew/went etc.

### Part C
The past simple (**did/saw/knew** etc.) can usually stay the same in reported speech, or you can change it to the past perfect (**had done/ had seen/ had known** etc.):
- direct
    - Paul said 'I **woke** up feeling ill, so I **didn't go** to work.'
- reported
    - Paul said (that) he **woke** up feeling ill, so he **didn't go** to work.
    - Paul said (that) he **had woken** up feeling ill, so he **hadn't gone** to work.

## Unit 48 Reported speech 2
### Part A It is not always necessary to change the verb in reported speech.
If the situation is still the same, you do not need to change the verb to the past. for ex:
- direct
    - Paul said 'My new job **is** boring'
    - Helen said '**I want** to go to Canada next year.'
- reported
    - Paul said that his new job **is** boring. (The situation is still the same. His job **is** still boring now.)
    - Helen told me that **she wants** to go to Canada next year. (Helen still wants to go to Canada next year.)

You can also change the verb to the past:
- Paul said that his new job **was** boring.
- Helen told me that she **wanted** to go to Canada next year.

But if the situation has changed or finished, you must use a past verb:
- Paul left the room suddenly. He said **he had** to go. (not has to go)

### Part B You need to use a past form when there is a difference between what was said and what is really ture.
For ex:
You met Sonia a few days ago
- She said: **Joe is in hospital.**

Later that day you meet Joe in the street. You say:
- Hi, Joe. I didn't expect to see you. Sonia said you **were** in hospital. (not 'Sonia said you are in hospital', because clearly he is not)

### Part C Say and tell
If you say who somebody is taking to, use **tell**:
- Sonia **told me** that you were in hospital. (not Sonia said me)
- What did you **tell the police**? (not say the police)

Otherwise use say:
- Sonia **said** that you were in hospital. (not Sonia told that...)
- What did you **say**?

But you can '**say** something **to** somebody':
- Ann **said** goodbye **to** me and left. (not Ann said me goodbye)
- What did you **say to** the police?

### Part D Tell / ask somebody to do something
We also use the infinitive (**to do / to be** etc) in reported speech, especially with **tell** and **ask** (for orders and requests):
- direct
    - '**Drink** plently of water,' the doctor said to me.
    - '**Don't be** late,' I said to Joe.
    - '**Can you help me, please,' Jackie said to me.
- reported
    - The doctor **told me to drink** plenty of water.
    - I **told Joe not to be** late.
    - Jackie **asked me to help** her.

You can also say 'Somebody **said (not) to** do something':
- Paul **said not to worry** about him. (but not Paul said me)
