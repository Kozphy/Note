We use the present perfect continuous for an activity that has recently stopped or just stopped

## Part B
We use present perfect continuous in this way, especially with **how long**, **for**... and **since**..., The activity is still happening (as in this example) or has just stopped.
- **How long have** you **been learning** English? (= you're still learning Engish)
- Ben is watching TV. He'**s been watching** TV **all day**.

You can use the present perfect continuous for repeated actions:
- Silvia is a very good tennis player. She'**s been playing since she was eight**.
- Every morning they meet in the same cafe. They'**ve been going** there **for years**.

## Part C
Compare **I am doing** and **I have been doing**:
- I am doing
    - Don't disturb me now. I'**m working**.
    - We need an umbrella. It'**s raining**.
    - Hurry up! We'**re waiting**.
- I have been doing
    - I'**ve been working** hard. Now I'm going to have a break.
    - The ground is wet. It'**s been raining**.
    - We'**ve been waiting** for an hour.
