## 句子理解
You can point to a real live cow chewing its cud in a pasture and equate it with the letters c-o-w on the page.

But you can't point to a real live plus sign that the symbol "+" is modeled after—the idea underlying the plus sign is more abstract.

應該是這樣的:
You can't point to a real live plus sign that the symbol "+" is modeled after.
這句裡的That 是關代，所以這句可以分成以下兩句
1. You can't point to a real live plus sign.
2. The symbol "+" is modeled after the real live plus sign.
