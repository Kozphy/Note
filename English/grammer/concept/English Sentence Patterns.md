## Subjects, Verbs, and Clauses
### Subject and Verb
In its simplest form, an English sentence has two parts: a **subject** and a **verb** that express a complete thought when they are together.
- The **subject** shows who or what is doing the action. It is always some form of noun or pronoun.
- The **verb** shows the action or the state of being. It can be an action verb, like “run,” or a state verb, like “seem.”

Examples of simple two word sentences include:

- Marvin slept.
- Dogs bark.
- Isotopes react.

### Clause
A **clause** is the `combination` of a `subject and a verb`. 

When you have a subject and verb, you have a clause. We’re going to concentrate on clauses in this handout, with emphasis on these two in particular:
1. `Independent clause`: a subject and verb that make a complete thought. Independent clauses are called independent because they can stand on their own and make sense.
1. `Dependent clause`: a subject and verb that don’t make a complete thought. Dependent clauses always need to be attached to an independent clause (they’re too weak to stand alone).

### Something tricky
Before we move on to the sentence types, you should know a little trick of subjects and verbs: they can double up in the same clause. These are called `“compound” subjects or verbs` because there are two or more of them in the same clause.

#### **Compound subject (two subjects related to the same verb):**
`Javier` and `his colleagues` collaborated on the research article.

#### **Compound verb (two verbs related to the same subject):**
Javier `conducted` the experiment and `documented` the results.

#### **Compound subject with compound verb:**
`Javier`, `his colleagues`, and `their advisor` **drafted** and **revised** the article several times.

> Notice that they don’t overlap. You can tell that it’s only one clause because all of the subjects in one clause come before all of the verbs in the same clause.

## Four Basic Patterns
Every sentence pattern below describes a different way to combine clauses.

> NOTE: Because nouns can fill so many positions in a sentence, it’s easier to analyze sentence patterns if you find the verbs and find the connectors. The most common connectors are listed below with the sentence patterns that use them.

### Pattern 1: Simple Sentence

One independent clause `(SV.)`
- Mr. Potato Head eats monkeys.
- I refuse.

### Pattern 2: Compound Sentence
**Two or more independent clauses**. They can be arranged in these ways: `(SV, and SV.)` or `(SV; however, SV.)`

- Connectors with a `comma`, the FANBOYS: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so 
- Connectors with a `semicolon` and `comma`: however, moreover, nevertheless, nonetheless, therefore

Example compound sentences:
- Mr. Potato Head eats them for breakfast every day, but I don’t see the attraction.
- Eating them makes him happy; however, he can’t persuade me.

### Pattern 3: Complex Sentence
One independent clause PLUS one or more dependent clauses. They can be arranged in these ways: `(SV because SV.)` or `(Because SV, SV.)` or `(S, because SV, V.)`

`Connectors` are always **at the beginning of the dependent clause**. They show how the dependent clause is related to the independent clause. **This list shows different types of relationships along with the connectors that indicate those relationships:**

- Cause/Effect: because, since, so that
- Comparison/Contrast: although, even though, though, whereas, while
- Place/Manner: where, wherever, how, however
- Possibility/Conditions: if, whether, unless
- Relation: that, which, who, whom
- Time: after, as, before, since, when, whenever, while, until

Examples of complex sentences:
- He recommends them highly `because` they taste like chicken `when` they are hot.
- `Although` chicken always appeals to me, I still feel skeptical about monkey.
- Mrs. Potato Head, `because` she loves us so much, has offered to make her special monkey souffle for us.
- She can cook it `however` she wants.
- `Although` I am curious, I am still skeptical.

### Pattern 4: Compound-Complex Sentence
Two or more independent clauses PLUS one or more dependent clauses. They can be arranged in these ways: `(SV, and SV because SV.)` or `(Because SV, SV, but SV.)`

**Connectors**: Connectors listed under Patterns 2 & 3 are used here. **Find the connectors, then find the verbs and subjects that are part of each clause.**

- Mr. Potato Head said that he would share the secret recipe; however, if he does, Mrs. Potato Head will feed him to the piranha, so we are both safer and happier if I don’t eat monkeys or steal recipes.
