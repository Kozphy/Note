# Present perfect 1 (I have done)
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A 
The present perfect simple is **have/has** + past participle. The past participle often ends in **-ed** (finish**ed**/decided**ed** etc),but many verbs are irregular (**lost**/**done**/**written** etc.)/

## Part B
When we say something **has happened**, this is usually new information:
- Ow! I'**ve cut** my finger.
- The road is closed. There'**s been** an accident. (= There **has been**...)

**When we use the present perfect, there is connection with now. The action in the past has a result now**.
- Tom **has lost** his key. (= he doesn't have it now)

Compare **gone (to)** and **been (to)**:
- James is on holiday. He **has gone to** Italy. (= he is there now or on his way there)
- Amy is back home now. She **has been** to Italy. (= she has now come back)

## Part C
You can use the present perfect with **just, already** and **yet**.
**Just** = a short time age:
- Hello. **Have** you **just arrived**?

**Already** = sooner than expected:
- Don't forget to pay the bill. I'**ve already paid** it.

**Yet** = until now. We use **yet** to show that we are expecting something to happen.
We use **yet** in question and negative sentences:
- **Has** it **stopped** raining **yet**?
- I've written the email, but I **haven't sent** it **yet**.

## Part D 
You can also use the past simple (**did**, **went**, **had** etc.) in the examples on this page. So you can say:
- Ben isn't here. He'**s gone** out. or He **went** out.
- Are you hungry? No,I'**ve** just **had** lunch. or No, I just **had** lunch.
