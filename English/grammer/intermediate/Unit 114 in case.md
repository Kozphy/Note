# Unit 114 in case
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
example:
Your car should have a spare wheel **in case** you have a puncutre. (= because it is possible you will have a puncture)

**In case** something happens = **because it is possible it will happen**

more example:
- I'd better write down my password **in case I forget it**. (= because it is possible I will forget it)
- Shall I draw a map for you **in case you have a problem** finding our house? (= because it is possible you will have problems finding it.)

We use **just in case** for a smaller possibility:
- I don't think it will rain, but I'll take an umbrella **just in case**. (= **just in case** it rains)

We do not use **will** after **in case** (see also Unit 25):
- I'll write down my password **in case** I **forget** it. (not in case I will forget)

## Part B
**In case** and **if** are not the same. We use **in case** to say why somebody does (or doesn't do) something.
You do something now **in case** something happens later.

Compare:
- **in case**
    - We'll buy some more food **in case** Tom comes. (= Maybe Tom will come. We'll buy some more food now, whether he comes or not. Then we'll already have the food he comes.)
    - I'll give you my phone number **in case** you need to contact me.
    - You should insure your bike **in case** it is stolen
- **if**
    - We'll buy some more food **if** Tom comes. (= Maybe Tom will come. If he comes we'll buy some more food. if he doesn't come, we won't buy any more food)
    - You can call me on this number **if** you need to contact me.
    - You should inform the police **if** you bike is stolen.

## Part C
You can use **in case** + **past to say why somebody did something**:
- I gave him my phone number **in case he needed** to contact me. (= because it was possible that he would need to contact me)
- I drew a map for Sarah **in case she had** a problem finding our house.
- We rang the door bell again **in case they hadn't heard** it the first time.

## Part D
**in case of** = **if there is...** (especially on notices, instructions etc.):
- **In case of fire**, please leave the building as quickly as possible. (= if there is a fire)
- **In case of emergency**, call this number. (= if there is am emergency)
