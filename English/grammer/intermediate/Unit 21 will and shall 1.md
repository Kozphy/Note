# Unit 21 will and shall 1
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
We use **I'll** ... (= I will) when we've just decided to do something. When we say '**I'll** do something', we announce our decision:
- Oh, I left the door open. **I'll go** and shut it.
- What would you like to drink? **I'll have** orange juice, please.

We often use **I think I'll**... / **I don't think I'll**...:
- I'm a little hungry. **I think I'll have** something to eat.
- **I don't think I'll go** out tonight. I'm too tired.

## Part B 
We often use **I'll** in these situations:
- Offering to do something
    - That bag looks heavy. **I'll help** you with it. (not I help)

- Agreeing to do something
    - A: Can you give Tom this book?
    - B: Sure, **I'll give** it to him when I see him this afternoon.

- Promising to do something
    - Thanks for lending me the money. **I'll pay** you back on Friday.
    - I **won't tell** anyone what happened. I promise.

We use **won't** to say that somebody refuses to do something:
- I've tried to give her advice, but she **won't liten**.

**Will you** (do something)? = please do it:
- **Will you** please turn the music down? It's too loud.

## Part C
We do not use **will** to talk about what has been decided or arranged before:
- **I'm going** on holiday next Saturday. (not I'll go)

## Part D
We use **shall** mostly in the questions **shall I**...? / **shall we** ...?

We use **shall**...? / **shall we** ...? to ask if it's OK to do something or to ask for a suggestion:
- **Shall I** open the window? (= do you want me to open it?)
- **Shall we** go? Just a minute. I'm not ready yet.

Compare **shall I**...? and **will you**...?:
- **Shall I** shut the door? (= do you want me to shut it?)
- **Will you** shut the door? (= I want you shut it)
