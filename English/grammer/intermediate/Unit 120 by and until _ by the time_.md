# Unit 120 **by** and **until** / **by the time**...
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
**by...** = not later than:
- I sent the documents today, so they should arrive **by Monday**. (= on or before Monday, not later than Monday)
- We'd better hurry. We have to be home **by 5 o'clock**. (= at or before 5 o'clock, not later than 5 o'clock)

## Part B
We use **until** (or **till**) to say how long a situation continues:
- Shall we go now? No, let's **wait until** it stops raining. or **...til** it stops raining.

Compare **until** and **by**
- until
    - Joe **will be away until** Monday. (so he'll be back on Monday)
    - I'**ll be working until** 11.30. (so I'll stop working at 11.30)
- by
    - Joe **will bee back by** Monday. (= not later than Monday)
    - I'**ll have finished my work by** 11.30. (= I'll finish it not later than 11.30)

## Part C
You can say "**by the time**" something happens:
- It's too late to go to the bank now. **By the time we get there**, it will be closed. (= it will close between now and the time we get there)
- You'll need plenty of time at the airport. **By the time you check in and go through security** it will be time for your flight. (= check-in and security will take a long time)

You can say "**by the time**" something happened (**for the past**):
- Karen's car broke down on the way to the party last night. **By the time she arrived**, most of the other guests had left. (= it took her a long time to do the work, and I became more and more tired)
- I had a lot of work to do yesterday evening. I was very tired **by the time I finished**. (= It took me a long time to do the work, and I became more and more tired)

You can say **by then** or **by that time**:
- Karen finally got to the party at midnight, but **by then** most of the other guests had left. or ...but **by that time**, most of the other guests had left.
