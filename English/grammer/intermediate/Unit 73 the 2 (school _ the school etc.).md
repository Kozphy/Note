# Unit 73 the 2 (school / the school etc.)
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A Compare school and the school
### school
Ellie is ten years old. Every day she goes **to school**. She's **at school** now. **School** starts at 9 and finishes at 3.

We say a child goes **to school** or is **at school** (as a student). We are not thinking of **school** as a general idea - children learning in a classroom.

### the school
Today Ellie's mother wants to speak to her daughter's teacher. So she has gone to **the school** to see her. She's at **the school** now.

Ellie's mother is not a student. She's not 'at school'. she doesn't 'go to school'. If she wants to see Ellie's teacher, she goes to **the school** (= Ellie's schools, a specific building)

## Part B
We use **prison (or jail), hospital, university, college and church** in a similar way. We do not use **the** when we are thinking of the general idea of these places and what they are used for.

## Part C
We say **go to bed / be in bed** etc. (not the bed):
- I'm going **to bed** now. Goodnight.
- Do you ever have breakfast **in bed**?
but
- I sat down on **the bed**. (a specific piece of furniture)

**go to work / be at work / start work / finish work** etc. (not the work):
- Chris didn't go to **work** yesterday.
