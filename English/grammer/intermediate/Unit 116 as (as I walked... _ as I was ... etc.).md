# Unit 116 **as** (**as** I walked... / **as** I was ... etc.)
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A **as** = at the same time as
You can use **as** when two things happen together at the same time:
- We all waved goodbye to Liz **as she drove away**. (we **waved** and she **drove** away at the same time)
- **As I walked along the street**, I looked in the shop windows.

Or you can say that something happened **as you were doing** something else (in the middle of doing something else):
- Kate slipped **as she was getting off the bus**.
- We me Paul **as we were leaving the hotel**.
For the past continuous (**was getting / were going** etc.), see Unit 6.

You can also use **just as** (= exactly at that moment):
- **Just as I sat down**, the doorbell rang.
- I had to leave **just as** the conversation was getting interesting.

Compare **as** and **when**:
- as
    - We use **as** only if two things happen at the same time.
        - **As I drove home**, I listened to music. (= at the same time)
- when
    - Use **when** (not as) if one thing happens after another.
        - **When I got home**, I had something to eat. (not as I got home)

## Part B
**as** = because

**As** also means 'because'
- **As I was hungry**, I decided to find somewhere to eat. (= because I was hungry)
- **As it's late and we're tired**, let's get a taxi home. (= because it's late...)

You can also use **since** in this way:
- **Since** it's late and we're tired, let's get a taxi home.
