# Unit 19 Present tenses (I am doing / I do) for the future
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
Present continuous (**I am doing**) with a future meaning

This is Ben's diary for next week.
- He **is playing** tennis on Monday afternoon.
- He **is going** to the dentist on Tuesday morning.
- He **is meeting** Kate on Friday.

In all these examples, Ben has already decided and arranged to do these things.

**I'm doing** something (tomorrow etc.) = I have already decided and arranged to do it:
- A: What **are** you **doing** on Saturday evening? (not What do you do)
    - B: I'**m going** to the cinema.
- I'**m not working** tomorrow, so we can go out somewhere.

We do not normally use **will** to talk about what we have arranged to do:
- What **are** you **doing** tonight? (not What will you do)
- Alex **is getting** married next month. (not will get)

We also use the present continuous for an action just before you start to do it. This happens especially with verbs of movement (**go/come/leave** etc.):
- I'm tired. I'**m going** to bed now
- Tina, are you ready yet? Yes, I'**m coming**.

## Part B
Present simple (**I do**) with a future meaning

We use the present simple when we talk about timetables and programmes (for ex, transport or cinema times):
- I have to go. My train **leaves** at 11.30.
- The meeting **is** at nine o'clock tomorrow.

You can use the present simple to talk about people if their plans are fixed like a timetable:
- I **start** my new job on Monday.

But the continuous is more usual for other personal arrangements:
- What time **are** you **meeting** Kate tomorrow? (not do you meet)

Compare:
- Present continuous
    - What time **are** you **arriving**?
- Present simple
    - What time **does** the train **arrive**?

When you talk about appointments, lessons, exams etc., you can use **I have** or **I've got**:
- **I have** an exam next week. or **I've got** an exam next week.
