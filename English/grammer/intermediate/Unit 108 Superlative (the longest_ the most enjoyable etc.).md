# Unit 108 Superlative (**the longest/ the most enjoyable** etc.)
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
example:
What is **the longest** river in the world?
What was **the most enojoyable** holiday you've ever had?

**Longest** and most **enjoyable** are superlative forms.

The superlative form is **-est** or **most**... . In general, we use **-est** for `short words` and **most**... for `longer words`.
- **long** -> long**est**
- **hot** -> hott**est**
- **easy** -> easi**est**
- **hard** -> hard**est**
- **most** famous
- **most** boring
- **most** enjoyable
- **most** difficult

A few superlative forms are irregular:
- good -> **best**
- bad -> **worst**
- far -> **furthest** or **farthest**

The rules are the same as those for the comparative - see Unit 105.
For spelling see Appendix 6.

## Part B
We normally use **the** (or **my/your** etc.) with a superlative:
- Yesterday was **the hottest** day of the year.
- The Louvre in Paris is one of **the most famous** museums in the world.

Compare the superlative and the comparative:
- This hotel is **the cheapest** in town. (superlative)
    - It's **cheaper** than all the others in town. (comparative)
- He's **the most patient** person I've ever met.
    - He's much **more patient** than I am.

## Part C
**oldest** and **eldest**
The superlative of **old** is **oldest**:
- That church is **the oldest** building in the town. (not the eldest)

We use **eldest** only when we talk about people in a family (you can also use **oldest**):
- **Their eldest son** is 13 years old. (or Their **oldest** son)

## Part D
After superlatives we normally use **in** with places:
- What's the longest river **in the world**? (not of the world)

We also use **in** for organisations and groups of people (a class / a company etc.):
- Who is the youngest student **in the class**? (not of the class)

For a period of time (**day, year** etc.), we normally use **of**:
- Yesterday was the hottest day **of the year**.
- What was the happiest day **of your life**?

## Part E
We often use the present perfect (I **have done**) fater a superlative. (see also Unit 8A):
- What's **the most important** decision **you've** ever **made**?
- That was **the best** holiday **I've had** for a long time.
