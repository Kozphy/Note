# Unit 89 **both/both of**, **neither/neither of**, **either/either of**
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
We use **both/neigher/either** for two things
You can use these words with a noun (**both books**, **neither book** etc.)

You can also use **both/neither/either** without a noun:
- Which do you prefer, besketball or tennis? It's hard to say. I like **both**.

## Part B
**both of .../ neither of... / either of**
We use **both of / neither of/ either of + the/these/my/Tom's**... etc. So we say "both of **the** restaurants", 'both of **those** restaurants', 'both of **those** restaurants' etc. (but not both of restaurants)

You don't need **of** after **both**. So you can say

We also use **both of / neither of/ either of + us/you/them**

We say "both **of**" before **us/you/them** (you need to use **of**)

After **neither of...** a verb can be singular or plural.

## Part C
You can say
- both...and...
- neither...nor...
- either...or...

## Part D
Compare **either/neither/both** (two things) and **any/none/all** (more than two)
