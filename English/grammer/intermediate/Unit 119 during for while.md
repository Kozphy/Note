# Unit 119 during for while
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A during
**during** = `at a time between the start and end of something`:
- I fell asleep **during the movie**. (= at a time between that start and end of the movie)
- We met some really nice people **during our holiday**.

With 'time words' (**the morning**, **the night**, **the summer** etc.),
you can usually say **in** or **during**:
- It rained **in the night**. or ...**during the night**.

## Part B **for** and **during**
We use **for** (+ a period of time) to say how long something goes on:
- We watched TV **for two hours** last night.
- Jess is going away **for a week** in September.

We do not use **during** to say **how long something goes on**. We do not say "during two hours", "during five years" etc.:
- It rained **for** three days without stopping. (not during three days)

We use **during** to say when something happens (not how long). Compare **during** and **for**:
- **When** did you fall asleep? **"During the movie."**
- **How long** were you asleep? **For half an hour.**

## Part C **during** and **while**
Compare:
- We use **during** + `noun`:
    - I fell asleep **during the movie**.
- We use **while** + `subject + verb`:
    - I fell asleep **while I was watching**.
    - We met a lot of interesting people **while we were on holiday**.

Some more examples of **while**:
- We saw Clare **while we were waiting** for the bus.
- **While you were** out, there was a phone call for you.

When we **are talking about the future**, we use the **present** after **while**. Do not use "will" (see Unit 25):
- I'm going to Moscow next week. I hope the weather will be good **while I'm** there. (not while I will be)
- What are you going to do **while you're** waiting? (not while you'll be waiting)
- Alex read a book **while Amy watched** TV.
