# Present perfect 2 (I have done) P.16
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
When we talk about a period of time that continues from the past until now, we use the present perfect (**have been / have travelled** etc.) 

- **Have** you **ever eaten** caviar?
- We'**ve** never **had** a car.
- I don't know what the film is about. I **haven't seen** it.

**been (to)** = visited:
- I'**ve** never **been to** Canada. Have you **been** there?

## Part C 
We say 'It's the (first) time something has **has happened**
- It's the first time he **has driven** a car. (not drives)
- He **hasn't driven** a car **before**.
- He **has never driven** a car **before**.

In the same way we say:
- Sarah has lost her passport again. This is the second time this **has happened**. (not happens)
- Andy is phoning his girlfriend again. It's the third time he'**s phoned** her **this evening**.
