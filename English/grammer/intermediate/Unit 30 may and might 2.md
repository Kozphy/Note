# Unit 30 may and might 2
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
We use **may** and **might** to talk about possible actions or happenings in the future:
- I haven't decided where to go on holiday. I **may go** to Ireland. (= perhaps I will go there)
- Take an umbrella with you. It **might rain** later. (= perhaps it will rain)

## Part B
we use **might** (not **may**) when the situation is not real:
- If they paid me better, I **might** work harder. (not I may work)

This situation (**If they paid** me better) is not real. They do not pay me well, so I'm not going to work harder.

## Part C
Compare **may/might be -ing** and **will be -ing**:
- Don't phone at 8.30. I'**ll be watching** the football on TV.
- Don't phone at 8.30. I **might be watching** the football on TV. (=perhaps I'll be watching it)

We also use **may/might be -ing** for possible plans. Compare:
- I'**m going** to Ireland soon. (for sure)
- I **might be going** (or I **may be going**) to Ireland soon. (possible)

## Part D might as well
We **might as well** do something = we should do it because there is no better alternative. There is no reason not to do it.

You can also use **may as well**.

- Buses are so expensive these days, you **might as well get** a taxi. (= taxis are as good, no more expensive than buses)
