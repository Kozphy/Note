# Unit 97 **-ing** and **-ed** clauses (the woman **talking to Tom**, the boy **injured in the accident**)

###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
A clause is a part of a sentence. Some clauses begin with **-ing**.
- Who is the woman **talking to Tom**?

We use **-ing** clauses to say what somebody (or something) is (or was) doing at a particular time.

You can also use an **-ing** clause to `say what happens all the time, not just at a particular time`.

## Part B
Some clauses begin with **-ed (injured, painted** etc.)
- The boy **injured in the accident** was taken to hospital.

**-ed** clauses have a passive meaning:
- The boy **injured in the accident** was taken to hospital. (he **was injured** in the  accident)

**injured/painted/used** are past participles. Most past participles and in **-ed**, but many are irregular (**stolen/made/built** etc.)
- The police nerver found the money **stolen in the robbery**.

## Part C
You can use **there is / there was** (etc.) + **-ing** and **-ed** clauses:
- **There were** some children **swimming** in the river.

We use **left** in this way, with the meaning 'not used, still there'
- We've eaten nearly all the chocolates. **There are** only a few **left**.
