# may and might 1
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A 
We use **may** and **might** to say that something is possible. You can use **may** or **might**:
- It **may** be true. or It **might** be true. (= perhaps it is true)
- She **might** know. or She **may** know.

The negative forms are **may not** and **might not**:
- It **may not** be true. (= perhaps it isn't true)
- She **might not** know. (= perhaps she doesn't know)

Note the difference between **may be** and **maybe**:
- It **may be** true. (may + verb)
- Is it true? **Maybe**. I'm not sure. (**maybe** = it's possible, perhaps)

## Part B
For the past we use **may have** .. or **might have**:
- A: I wonder why Kate didn't answer her phone.
    - B: She **may have been** asleep. (= perhaps she was asleep)
- A: I can't find my phone anywhere.
    - B: You **might have left** it at work. (=perhaps you left it at work)

## Part C
**could** is similar to **may** and **might**:
- It's a strange story, but it **could be** true. (= it is possible that it's true)
- You **could have left** your phone at work. (= it's possible that you left it there)

But **couldn't** (negative) is different from **may not** and **might not**. Compare:
- Sarah **couldn't have received** my message. Otherwise she would have replied. (= it is not possible that she got my message)
- Why hasn't Sarah replied to my message? I suppose she **might not have received** it. (= it's possible that she didn't receive it - perhaps she did, perhaps she didn't)
