# Unit 117 **like** and **as**
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
**Like** = similar to, the same as:
- What a beautiful house! It's **like a palace**. (not as a palace)
- Be careful! The floor has been polished. It's **like walking on ice**. (not as walking)

In these ex, **like** is a preposition. So it is followed by a **noun** (like a **palace**), a **pronoun** (like **this**) or **-ing** (like walk**ing**)

Sometimes **like** = for example. You can also use **such as**:
- I enjoy water sports, **like** surfing, scuba diving and water-skiing. or I enjoy water sports, **such as** surfing...

## Part B
**As** = in the same way as, in the same condition as.
We use **as** with subject (S) + verb (V):
- I didn't move anything. I left everything **as it was**.
- You should have done it **as I showed** you.

|     | S      | V          |
| --- | ------ | ---------- |
| as  | **it** | **was**    |
| as  | **I**  | **showed** |

We alsu use **like** in this way (+ subject + verb):
- I left evertyhing **like it was**.

Compare **as** and **like**. You can say:
- You should have done it **as it showed you**. or **... like I showed you**. 
- You should have done it **like this**. (not as this)

We say **as usual / as always**:
- You're late **as usual**.
- **As always**, Nick was the first to complain.

We say **the same as**...:
- Your phone is **the same as** mine. (not the same like)

## Part C
Sometimes **as** (+ subject + verb) has other meanings, For ex, after **do**:
- You can do **as you like**. (= do what you like)
- They did **as they promised**. (= They did what they promised.)

We also say **as you know / as I said / as she expected / as I thought** etc.:
- **As you know**, it's Emma's birthday next week. (= you know this already)
- Andy failed his driving test, **as he expected**. (= he expected this before)

**Like** it not usual in these expressions, except with **say** (**like I said**):
- **As I said** yesterday, I'm sure we can solve the problem. or **Like I said** yesterday...

## Part D
**As** can also be a preposition (**as** + noun), but the meaning is different from **like**.

Compare
- **As a taxi driver**, I spend most of my working life in a car. (I am a taxi driver, it's my job.)
- Everyone in the family wants me to drive them to places. I'm **like a taxi driver**. (I'm not a taxi driver, but I'm like one.)

**As (preposition)** = in the position of, in the form of etc.:
- Many years ago I worked **as a photographer**. (I was a photographer)
- Many words, for ex "work" and "rain", can be used **as verbs or nouns**.
