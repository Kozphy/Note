## Part A
- I've been painting my bedroom.
    - There is paint on Kate's clothes.
    - She **has been painting** her bedroom.
    - **has been painting** is the present perfect continuous.
    - **We are thinking of the activity**. It does not matter  whether it has been finished or not.

- I've painted my bedroom.
    - The bedroom was green. Now it is yellow.
    - She **has painted** her bedroom.
    - **has painted** is the present perfect simple.
    - **Here, the important thing is that something has been finished**. 'She **has painted**' is a completed action. We are thinking about the result of the activity (the painted bedroom), not the activity itself.

## Part B
Compare:
- present perfect continuous
    - My hands are very dirty. I'**ve been repairing** my bike.
- present perfect
    - My bike is OK again now. I'**ve repaired it**. (=I've finished repairing it)

## Part C
We use the continuous to say how long (for something that is still happening):
- How long **have** you **been reading** that book?
- Amy is writing emails. She'**s been writing** emails all morning.
- They'**ve been playing** tennis since 2 o'clock.
- I'm learning Arabic, but I **haven't been learning** it very long.

We use the simple to say how much, how many or how many times (for completed actions):
- How many pages of that book **have** you **read**?
- Amy **has sent** lots of emails this morning.
- They'**ve played** tennis three times this week.
- I'm learning Arabic, but I **haven't learnt** very much yet.

## Part D
Some verbs (for ex, **know**) are not normally used in coninuous forms (**be + ing**):
- I'**ve known** about the problem for a long time. (not I've been knowing)
- How long **have** you **had** that camera? (not have you been having)
