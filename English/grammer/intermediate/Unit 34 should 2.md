# Unit 34 should 2
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
You can use **should** after:
- insist
- demand
- recommend
- suggest
- propose

**It's important/vital/necessary/essential** that ...**should**...:
- **It's essential** that everyone **should be** here on time.

## Part B
You can also leave out **should** in the sentences in section A.
- **It's essential** that everyone **be** here on time. (=...that everyone **should be** here...)
- I **insisted** that he **apologise**. (= ... that he **should apologise**)
- What do you **suggest** we **do**?
- Many people are **demanding** that something **be done** about the problem.

This form (**be/do/apologise** etc.) is called the subjunctive. It is the same as the infinitive (without **to**). You can also use normal present and past forms:
- It's **essential** that everyone **is** here on time.
- I **insisted** that he **apologised**.

## Part C
We do not use **to** ... with **suggest**. You can say:
- What do you **suggest we should do**?
Jane won the lottery.
- I **suggested** that she **should buy** a car with the money she won.

You can also use **-ing** after **suggest** (What do you **suggest doing**?)

## Part D
You can use **should** after some adjectives, especially:
- strange
- odd
- funny
- typical
- natural
- interesting
- surprised
- surprising

used after "that" and adjectives or nouns that show an opinion or feeling
- It's **strange** that he **should be** late. He's usually on time.

## Part E
You can say '**if** something **should** happen...' for ex:
- We have no jobs at present, but **if** the situation **should change**, we will contact you.

You can also begin with **should** (**Should** something happen...):
- **Should** the situation **change**, we will contact you.

This means the same as '**If** the situation **changes**,...' With **should**, the speaker feels that the possibility is smaller.

## Part F
You can use **I should**.../ **I shouldn't**... to give advice. For ex
- Shall I leave now? No, **I should wait** a bit. (= I advise you to wait)

Here, **I should**... = 'I would... if I were you, I advise you to...' Two more ex:
- I'm going out now. Is it cold outside? Yes, **I should wear** a coat.
- **I shouldn't stay** up too late. You have to be up early tomorrow.
