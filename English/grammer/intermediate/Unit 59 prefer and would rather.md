# Unit 59 prefer and would rather
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A prefer to... and perfer -ing
When you say what you prefer in general, you can use **prefer to...** or **prefer -ing**:
- I don't like cities. I **prefer to live** in the country. or I **prefer living** in the country.

## Part B would prefer (I'd prefer...)
We use **would perfer** to say what somebody wants in a specific situation (not in general):
- **Would** you **prefer** tea or coffee? Coffee, please.

We say 'would prefer **to do** something'(not usually would prefer doing):
- Shall we go by train? I'**d prefer to drive**. (= I **would** prefer...)

## Part C would rather (I'd rather...)
**I'd rather** = I **would** rather. **I'd rather do** something = **I'd prefer to do** it.
We say **I'd rather** do (not to do). Compare:
- Shall we go by train?
    - I'**d rather drive** (not to drive)
    - I'**d prefer to drive**.
The negative is I'**d rather not**...:
- I'm tired. I'**d rather not go** out this evening, if you don't mind.

We say **I'd rather do** one thing **than do** another:
- I'**d rather stay at home tonight **than go** to the cinema.

## Part D I'd rather somebody did something
We say **I'd rather** you **did** something (not I'd rather you do)
- Who's going to drive, you or me? **I'd rather** you **drove**. (= I would prefer this)

We use the past (**drove,did** etc.) here, but the meaning is present not past. Compare:
- I'd rather **make** dinner now.
- I'd rather **you made** dinner now. (not I'd rather you make)

I'd rather **you didn't** (do something) = I'd prefer you not to do it:
- I'**d rather you didn't tell** any one what I said.
