# Unit 67 **see somebody do** and **see somebody doing**
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A see somebody do
Tom got into his car and drove off.
- I saw Tom **get** into his car and **drive** off.

We say 'I saw him **do** something' (= his did it and I saw this)
- I didn't **hear** you **come** in.
- Lisa suddenly **felt** somebody **touch** her on the shoulder.

## Part B see somebody doing
Yesterday you saw Kate. She was waiting for a bus. You can say:
- I saw Kate **waiting** for a bus.

We say 'I saw her **doing** something' (= she was doing it and I saw this). in the same way, you can say:
- I could **hear** it **raining**. (it was raining - I could hear it)
- **Listen to** the birds **singing**!
- Can you **smell** something **burning**?
- We looked for Paul and finally we **found** him **sitting** under a tree **eating** an apple.

## Part C difference in meaning
I **saw him do** something = he **did** something and I saw this.
I saw the complete action from start to finish:
- He **jumped** over the was and **run** away. --> I **saw** him **jump** over the wall and **run** away.

I **saw him doing** something = he **was doing** something and I saw this:
- I saw Tom as I drove past in my car. He **was walking** along the street. --> I **saw** Tom **walking** along the street.

Sometimes the difference is not importtant and you can use either form:
- I've never seen her **dance**. or I've never seen her **dancing**.
