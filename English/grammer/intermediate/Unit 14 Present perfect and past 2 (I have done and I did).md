# Unit 14 Present perfect and past 2 (I have done and I did)
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A 
We do not use the present perfect (**I have done**) when we talk about a finished time (for ex, **yesterday / last year/ ten minutes ago** etc.). We use a past tense:
- It **was** very cold **yesterday**. (not has been)

Use the past to ask **When**...? or **What time**...?:
- **When did** your friends **arrive**? (not have... arrived)
- **What time did** you **finish** work?

Compare:
- Present perfect
    - Tom **has lost** his key. He can't get into the house.
    - Is Carla or **has** she **left**?
- Past simple
    - Tom **lost** his key **yesterday**. He couldn't get into the house.
    - **When did** Carla **leave**?

## Part B
- Present perfect (have done)
    - I'**ve done** a lot of work **today**.
We use the present perfect for a period of time that continues until now. For ex: **today / this week / since 2010**.
- Past simple (did)
    - I **did** a lot of work **yesterday**.
We use the past simple for a finished time in the past. For ex: **yesterday / last week / from 2010 to 2014**.
