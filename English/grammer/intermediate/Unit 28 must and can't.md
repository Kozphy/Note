# Unit 28 must and can't
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A 
We ues **must** to say that we believe something is certain:
- You've been travelling all day. You **must be** tired. (travelling is tiring and you've been travelling all day, so you **must** be tired)

We ise **can't** to say that we believe something is not possible:
- You've just had lunch. You **can't be** hungry already. (we don't expect poeple to be hungry immediately after a meal)

## Part B
For the past we use **must have**... and **can't have**...:
- I lost one of my gloves. I **must have dropped** it somewhere. (that's the only explanation I can think of)
- Sarah hasn't contacted me. She **can't have got** my message.
- Max walked into a wall. He **can't have been looking** where he was going.
