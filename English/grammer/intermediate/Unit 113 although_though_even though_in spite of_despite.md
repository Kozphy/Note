# Unit 113 **although/though/even though/in spite of/despite**
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
example:
Last year Paul and Sarah had a holiday by the sea it rained a lot, but they had a good time.

You can say:
**Although it rained** a lot, they had a good time. (= It rained a lot, but they...)

or

**<in spite of**, **Despite>**
- <in spite of/ Despite> **the rain**, they had a good time.

## Part B
After **although** we use a subject + verb:
- **Although it rained** a lot, they had a good time.
- I didn't apply for the job **although I had** the necessary qualifications.

Compare the meaning of **although** and **because**:
- We went out **although** it was raining heavily.
- We didn't go out **because** it was raining heavily.

## Part C
After **in spite of** or **despite**, we use a noun, a pronoun (**this/that/what** etc.) or **-ing**:
- **In spite of the rain**, we had a good time.
- She wasn't well, but **in spite of this** she continued working.
- **In spite of what** I said yesterday, I still love you.

**Dispite** is the same as **in spite of**. We say **in spite of**, but **despite** (without of):
- She wasn't well, but **despite this** she continued working. (not despite of this)

You can say '**in spite of the fact** (that)...' and '**despite the fact** (that)...'
- I didn't apply for the job <in spite of the fact (that)/ despite the fact (that)> I had the necessary qualifications.

Compare **in spite of** and **because of**:
- We went out **in spite of the rain**. (or ...**despite the rain**.)
- We didn't go out **because of the rain**.

## Part D
Compare **although** and **in spite of / despite**:
- <**Although the traffic was** bad / **In spite of the traffic**> we arrived on time. (not in spite of the traffic was bad)
- I couldn't sleep <**although I was** very tired. / **despite being** very tired.> (not despite I was tired)

## Part E
**though** = **although**:
- I didn't apply for the job **though** I had the necessary qualifications.

In spoken English we often use **though** at the end of a sentence:
- The house isn't so nice. I like the garden **though**. (= but I like the garden)
- I see them every day. I've never spoken to them **though**. (= but I've never spoken to them)

**Even though** (but not 'even' alone) is similar to **although**:
- **Even though** I was really tired, I couldn't sleep. (not even I was really tired)
