# Unit 105 Comparative 1 (**cheaper, more expensive** etc.)
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
How shall we travel? Shall we drive or go by train?
- Let's drive. It's **cheaper**.
- Dont' go by train. It's **more expensive**.

After comparaatives yoiu can use **than** (see Unit 107):
- It's **cheaper** to drive **than** go by train.
- Going by train is **more expensive than** driving.

## Part B
The comparative form is **-er** or **more**...
We use **-er** for short words (`one syllable`):
- cheap -> cheaper
- large -> larger
- fast -> faster
- thin -> thinner

We also use **-er** for `two-syllable` words that end in **-y** (**-y -> -ier**):
- lucky -> luckier
- early -> earlier
- easy -> easier
- pretty -> prettier

For spelling, see Appendix 6.

We use **more**... for longer words (two syllables or more):
- more serious
- more often
- more expensive
- more comfortable

We also use **more**... foro adverbs that end in **-ly**:
- more slowly
- more easily
- more seriously
- more quietly

Compare these examples:
- -er
    - You're **older** than me.
    - The exam was quite easy - **easier** than I expected.
- more
    - You're **more patient** than me.
    - The exam was quite difficult - **more difficult** than I expected.

We use both **-er** or **more** ... with some `two-syllable adj`, especially:
- clever
- narrow
- quiet
- shallow
- simple

It's too noisy here. Can we go somewhere **quieter**? or somewhere **more quiet**.?
## Part C
A few adj and adv have irregular comparative forms:
- **good/well** -> **better**
    - The garden looks **better** since you tidied it up.
    - I know him well - probably **better** than any body else knowns him.
- **bad/badly** -> **worse**
    - How's your headache? Better? No, it's **worse**.
    - He did very badly in the exam - **worse** than expected.
- **far** -> **further** (or **father**)
    - It's a long walk from here to park - **further** than I thought. (or **farther** than)
- Note that **further** (but not farther) also means 'more' or 'additional':
    - Let me know if you hear any **further** news. (= any more news)
