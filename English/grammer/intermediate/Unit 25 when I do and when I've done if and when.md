# Unit 25 when I do and when I've done if and when
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
### situation
Amy is on a train. She's calling a friend.
I'll call you again later **when I arrive**.

### explain
I'll call you again later when I arrive' is a sentence with two parts:
- the main part 
    - I'll call you again later
- and **when**... 
    - when I arrive

The time is future ('later'), but Amy says:
...**when** I arrive. (not when I will arrive)

We say
**when** I **do** something. (not will do)
**when** something **happens** (not will happen)

The same thing happens after **while / before / after / as soon as / until**:
- What are you going to do **while I'm** away? (not while I will be)
- **Before** you **go**, there's something I want to ask you.
- Wait here **until** I **come** back. or ...**till** I **come** back.

## Part B
You can also use the present perfect (**have done**) after **when / after / until / as soon as**

We use the present perfect ot show that one thing is complete before the other. The two things do not happen together:
- **When** I'**ve phoned** Kate, we can go out. (= first I'll phone Kate and after that we can go out)

Do not use the present perfect if the two things happen together:
- **When** I **phone** Kate, I'll ask her about the party. (not when I've phoned)

It is often possible to use either the present simple or the present perfect

## Part C if and when
After **if**, we normally use the present (**if** I **do** / **if** I **see** etc.) for the future:
- I'll be angry **if** it **happens** again. (not if it will happen)
- Hurry up! **If** we **don't** hurry, we'll be late.

We use **if** (not when) for things that will possibly happen (or not happen):
- **If** it is raining this evening, I won't go out. (not when it is raining)
- Don't worry **if** I'm late tonight. (not when I'm late)
- **If** they don't come soon, I'm not going to wait for them.

We use **when** for things which are sure to happen.
- I might go out later. (it's possible) **If** I go out, I'll get some bread.
- I'm going out later. (for sure) **When** I go out, I'll get some bread.
