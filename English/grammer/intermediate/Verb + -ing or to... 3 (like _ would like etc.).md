# Verb + -ing or to... 3 (like / would like etc.)
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A like / love / hate
When you talk about repeated actions, you can use **-ing** or **to...** after these verbs.
- Do you **like getting** up early? or Do you **like to get** up early?
- Stephanie **hates flying**. or Stephanie **hates to fly**.
- I **love meeting** people. or I **love to meet** people.

We use **-ing** (not **to...**) when we `talk about a situation that already exists (or existed)`.
- Paul lives in Berlin now. He **likes living** there. (he lives there now and he likes it)
- Do you **like being** a student? (you are a student - do you like it?)

These is sometimes a difference between **I like to do** and **I like doing**:
- **I like doing** something = I do it and I enjoy it:
    - I **like cleaning** the kitchen. (= I enjoy it.)

I **like to do** something = I choose to do it (but maybe I don't enjoy it):
- It's not my favourite job, but I **like to clean** the kitchen as often as possible.

Note that we use **-ing** with **enjoy** and **mind**

## Part B would like / would love / would hate / would prefer
**Would like / would love** etc. are usually followed by **to...**:
- I'**d like** (= I **would** like) to go away for a few days.
- What **would** you **like to do** this evening?
- I **wouldn't like to go** on holiday alone.

Compare **I like** and **I would like (**I'd** like):
- I **like playing** tennis. / I **llike to play** tennis. (= I like it in general)
- I'**d like to play** tennis today. (= I want to play today)

## Part C I would like to have (done something)
I would like **to have done** something = `I regret now that I didn't or couldn't do it`:
- We'**d like to have gone** away, but we were too busy at home.

We use the same structure after **would love/ would hate/ would prefer**:
- Poor David! I **would hate to have been** in his position
- I'**d love to have gone** to the party, but it was impossible.
