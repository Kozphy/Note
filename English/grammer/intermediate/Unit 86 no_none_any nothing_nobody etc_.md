# Unit 86 **no/none/any** **nothing/nobody** etc.
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A **no** and **none**
We use **no** + noun (**no bus**, **no shops** etc).
**no** = **not a** or **not any**:
- We had to walk home. There was **no bus** (= There **wasn't a** bus)

You can use **no** + noun at the beginning of a sentence:
- **No reason** was given for the change of plan.

We use **none** without a noun:
- 'How much money do you have?' '**None**' (= no money)

Or we use **none of**...:
- This money is all yours. **None of it** is mine.

Compare **no, none** and **any**:
- I have **no langgage**.
- 'How much luggage do you have?' '**None**' or 'I **don't** have any'.

After **none of** + plural (none of **the students**, none of **them** etc.) the verb can be singular or plural:
- None of the students **were** happy. or None of the students **was** happy.

## Part B **nothing**, **nobody/no-one**, **nowhere**
- You can use these words at the beginning of a sentence or alone (as answers to questions)

You can also use these words after a verb, especially after **be** and **have**:
- The house is empty. There'**s nobody** living there.

**nothing**/**nobody** etc. = **not** + **anything**/**anybody** etc.

With **nothing/nobody** etc., we do not use a negative verb (**isn't, didn't** etc.)

## Part C 
After **nobody/no-one** you can use **they/them/their** (see also Unit85E):
- **Nobody** is perfect, are **they**? (= is he or she perfect?)
- **No-one** did what I asked **them** to do. (= him or her)
- **Nobody** in the class did **their** homework. (= his or her homework)

## Part D
Sometimes **any/anything/anybody** etc. means 'it doesn't matter which/what/who' (see Unit85D).

Compare **no-** and **any-**:
- There was **no** bus, so we walked home.
    - You can take **any** bus. They all go to the centre. (=it doesn't matter which bus)
- 'What do you want to eat?' **Nothing**. I'm not hungry.
    - I'm so hungry. I could eat **anything** (= it doesn't matter what)
- It's a difficult job. **Nobody** wants to do it.
    - It's a very easy job. **Anybody** can do it. (= it doesn't matter who)
