# Unit 61 be/get used to...(I'm used to...)
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A situation
Lisa is American, but she lives in Britain.
When she first drove a car in Britain, driving on the left was a problem for her because:

She **wasn't used to it**.
She **wasn't used to driving** on the left. (because Americans drive on the left.)

But after some time, driving on the left became easier.
She **got used to driving** on the left.

Now it's not problem for Lisa:
She **is used to driving** on the left.

## Part B I'm used to something = it is not new or stange for me
- You can say:
    - be used to something
    - get used to doing something
- Paul lives alone. He has lived alone for a long time, so it is not strange for him. He'**s used to it**. He **is used to living** alone.
- Our new apartment is on a busy street. I expect we'**ll get used to the noise**, but at the moment it's very disturbing.

## Part C We say 'be/get used **to doing** something'(not I'm used to do)
- Lisa is used **to driving** on the left. (not I'm used to do)
- I'm used **to lliving** alone. (not I'm used to live)

When we say '**I'm used to...**', **to** is a preposition:
- We're not used **to**
    - the noise.
    - it.
    - living here (not live here)

Compare **to** + infinitive (**to do**, **to live** etc.)
- We don't want **to live** here.

## Part D Compare **I am used to doing** and **I used to do**:
I **am** used **to (doing)** something = it isn't strange or new for me:
- I'**m** used **to the weather** here.
- I'**m** used **to driving** on the left because I've lived in Britain a long time.

I **used to do** something = I did it regularly in the past but no longer do it. We use this only for the past (I used...), not for the present.
- I **used to drive** to work every day, but these days I usually go by bike.
- We **used to live** just outside the town, but now we live near the centre.
