# Unit 111 **still, any more, yet, already**

## Part A
We use **still** to say that a **situation or action is continuing. It hasn't changed or stopped**:
- It's ten o'clock and Joe is **still** in bed.
- When I went to bed, Chris was **still** working.
- Do you **still** want to go away or have you changed your mind?

**Still** also means **"in spite of this"**. for ex:
- He has everything he needs, but he's **still** unhappy.

**Still** usually goes in the middle of the sentence with the verb. See Unit 110.

## Part B
We use **not...any more** or **not...any longer** to say that a situation has changed.
**Any more** and **any longer** go at the end of a sentence:
- Lucy **doesn't** work here **any more**. She left last month. or
    - Lucy **doesn't** work here **any longer**.

You can write **any more** (2 words) or **anymore** (1 word).

You can also use **no longer**. **No longer** goes in the middle of the sentence:
- Lucy **no longer** works here.

We do not normally use **no more** in this way:
- We are **no longer** friends. (not we are not more friends)

Compare **still** and **not...any more**:
- Sally **still** works here, but Lucy **doesn't** work here **any more**.

## Part C
We use **yet** mainly in negative sentences (**He isn't** here **yet**) and questions (**Is he** here **yet**?)
**Yet** (= until now) shows that the speaker expects something to happen.

**Yet** usually goes at the end of a sentence:
- It's 10 o'clock and Joe **isn't** here **yet**.
- **Have** you **decided** what to do **yet**?

We often use **yet** with the present perfect ("**Have** you **decided** ... **yet**?"). See Unit 7C.

Compare **yet** and **still**:
- Mike lost his job six months ago and **is still** unemployed.
    - Mike lost his job six monthes ago and **hasn't found** another job **yet**.
- **Is** it **still** raining? 
    - **Has** it **stopped** raining **yet**?

**Still** is also possible in **negative** sentences (before the negative):
- She said she would be here an hour ago and she **still hasn't** come.

This is similar to "she hasn't come **yet**". But **still...not** shows a **stronger feeling of surprise or impatience**. Compare:
- I sent him an invitation last week. He **hasn't** replied **yet**. (but I expect he will reply soon)
- I sent him an invitation weeks ago and he **still hasn't** replied. (he sould have replied before now)

## Part D
We use **already** to say that **something happened sooner than expected**.
- What time is Sue leaving? "She has **already** left." (= sooner than you expected)
- Shall I tell Joe what happened or does he **already** know?

**Already** usually goes **in the middle of a sentence** (see Unit 110) or at the end:
- She's **already** left. or She's left **already**.
