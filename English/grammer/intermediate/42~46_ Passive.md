# 42~46: Passive
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Unit 42 Passive 1 (is done / was done)
### Part A example
This house **was built** in 1961.

**Was built** is passive.

Compare active and passive.

Somebody **built** this house in 1961. (active)

This house **was built** in 1961. (passive)

When we use an active verb, we say what the subject does:
- My grandfater was a builder. **He built** this house in 1961.
- It's a big company. **It employs** two hundred people.

When we use a passive verb, we say what happens to the subject:
- How old is this house? **It was built** in 1961.
- **Two hundred people are employed** by the company.

### Part B the action doesn't important when use passive
When we use the passive, who or what causes the action is often unknown or unimportant:
- A lot of money **was stolen** in the robbery. (somebody stole it, but we don't know who)
- **Is** this room **cleaned** every day? (does somebody clean it? - it's not important who)

If we want to say who does or what causes the action, we use **by**:
- This house was built **by my grandfather**.
- Two hundred people are employed **by the company**.

### Part C present and past passive
The passive is **be** (**is/was** etc.) + past participle (**done/cleaned/seen** etc.):
- (be) done
- (be) cleaned
- (be) damaged
- (be) built
- (be) seen

## Unit 44 Passive 3
### Part A  I was offered... / we were given... etc.
Some verbs can ahve two objects. For ex, give:
- Somebody gave **the police the information**. (= somebody gave the information to the police)

So it is possible to make two passive sentences:
- **The police** were given the information
- **The information** was given to the police.

Other verbs which can have two objects are:
- ask
- offer
- pay
- show
- teach
- tell

When we use these verbs in the passive, most often we begin with the person:
- **I've been offered** the job, but I don't think I'll accept it. (= they have offered me the job)
- **You will be given** plenty of time to decide. (= we will give you plenty of time)
- I didn't see the original document but **I was shown** a copy. (= somebody showed me)

### Part B I don't like being ...
The passive of **doing/seeing** etc. is **being done / being seen** etc. Compare:
- active
    - I don't like **people telling me** what to do.
- passive
    - I don't like **being told** what to do.
    - I remember **being taken** to the zoo when I was a child. (= I remember somebody taking me to the zoo)
    - Steve hates **being kept** waiting. (= he hates people keeping him waiting)
    - We managed to climb over the wall without **being seen**. (= without anybody seeing us)


### Part C I was born...
We say **I was born...** (not I am born)
- I **was born** in Chicago.
- Where **were** you **born**?

but
- How many babies **are born** every day?

### Part D Get
You canuse **get** instead of **be** in the passive:
- There was a fight at the party, but nobody **get hurt**. (= nobody **was** hurt)
- I don't **get invited** to many parties. (= I'**m** not invited)
- I'm surprised Liz **didn't get offered** the job. (= Liz **wasn't offered** the job)

We use **get** only when things happen. For ex, you cannot use **get** in these sentences:
- Jessica **is liked** by everybody. (not gets liked - this is not a happening)
- Peter was a mystery man. Very little **was known** about him. (not got known)

We usd **get** mainly in informal spoken English. You can use **be** in all situations.

We also use **get** in the following expressions (which are not passive in meaning):
- get married, get divorced
- get dressed (= put on your clothes)
- get lost (= not know where you are)
- get changed (= change your clothes)

## Unit 45 It is said that... , He is said to..., He is supposed to...
### Part A situation
George is very old. Nobody knows exactly how old he is, but:
- **It is said that** he is 108 years old.
- He **is said to be** 108 years old

Both these sentences mean: People say that he is 108 years old.

You can use these structures with a number of other verbs, expecially:
- alleged
- believed
- considered
- expected
- known
- reported
- thought
- understood

Compare two structure:
- Cathy loves running.
    - **It is said that** she runs ten miles a day.
    - She **is said to run** ten miles a day.
- The police are looking for a missing boy.
    - **It is believed that** the boy is wearing. a white sweater and blue jeans.
    - The boy **is believed to be wearing** a white sweater and blue jeans.
- The strike started three weeks ago.
    - **It is expected that** she strike will end soon.
    - The strike **is expected to end** soon.
- A friend of mine has been arrested.
    - **It is alleged that** he hit a policeman.
    - He **is alleged to have hit** a policeman.
- The two houses belong to the same family
    - **It is said that** there is a secret tunnel between them.
    - There **is said to be** a secret tunnel between them.

These structures are often used in news reports. for ex, in a report about an accident.
- **It is reported that** two people were injured in the explosion.
- Two people **are reported to have been injured** in the explosion.

### Part B (Be) supposed to
- Sometimes (it is) supposed to... = (it is) said to ...:
    - I want to see that film. It'**s supposed to be** good. (= it is said to be good)
    - Fireworks **are supposed to have been invented** in China. Is is true?

But sometimes **supposed to** has a different meaning. We use **supposed to** to say what what is intended, arranged or expected. Often this is different from the real situation:
- The plan **is supposed to be** a secret, but everybody seem to know about it. (= the plan is intended to be a secret)
- What are you doing at work? You'**re supposed to be** on holiday.(= you arranged to be on holiday)
- Our guests **were supposed to come** at 7.30, but they were late.
- Jane **was supposed to phone** me last night, but she didn't.
- I'd better hurry. I'**m supposed to be meeting** Chris in ten minutes.

You're **not supposed to** do something = it is not allowed or advisable:
- You'**re not supposed to park** your car here. It's private parking only.
- Jeff is much better after his illness, but he'**s** still **not supposed to do** heavy work.

## Unit 46 Have something done
### Part A situation
The roof of Lisa's house was damaged in a storm.
So she called a builder, and yesterday a man came and repaired it.

Lisa **had** the roof **repaired** yesterday.

This means: Lisa arranged for somebody else to repair the roof. She didn't repair it herself.

We use **have something done** to say that we arrange for somebody else to do something for us Compare:
- repair active and passive
    - Lisa **repaired** the roof. (= she repaired it herself)
    - Lisa **had** the roof **repaired**. (= she arranged for somebody else to repair it)
- make active and passive
    - Did you **make** those curtains yourself? Yes, I enjoy making things.
    - Did you **have** those curtains **made**? No, I made them myself.

### Part B Be careful with word order. The past participle (repaired/ cut etc.) is after the object
- Lisa **had** the roof **repaired** yesterday.
- Where did you **have** your hair **cut**?
- Your hair looks nice. Have you **had** it **cut**?
- Our neighbour has just **had** a garage **built**.
- We are **having** the house **painted** this week.
- How often do you **have** your car **serviced**?
- I think you should **have** that coat **cleaned**.
- I don't like **having** my picture **taken**.

### Part C Get something done
You can also say "**get** something done" instead of "**have** something done"
- When are you going to **get the roof repaired**? (= have the roof repaired)
- I think you should **get your hair cut** really short.

### Part D have something done
Sometimes **have something done** has a different meaning. For ex:
- Paul and Karen **had their bags stolen** while they were travelling.

This does not mean that they arranged for somebody to steal their bags. "They **had their bags stolen**" means only: "Their bags were stolen"

With this meaning, we usd **have something done** to say that something happens to somebody or their belongings. Often what happens is not nice:
- Gary **had** his nose **broken** in a fight. (= his nose was broken)
- Have you ever **had** you bike **stolen**?
