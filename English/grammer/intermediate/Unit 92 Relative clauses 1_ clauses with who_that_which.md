# Unit 92 Relative clauses 1: clauses with **who/that/which**
###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`

## Part A
example:
Last week we had a party and a lot of people came. Everybody enjoyed it.
Everybody **who came to the party** enjoyed it.

A clause is a part of a sentence. A relative clause tells us which person or thing (or what kind of person or thing) the speaker means
- the woman **who lives next door to me**. ('who lives next door to me' tells us which woman)
- people **who complain all the time**. ('who complain all the time' tells us what kind of people)

We use **who** in a relative clause for people (not things)

We also use **that** for people, but not **which**

Sometimes you must use **who** (not that) for people - see Unit 95.

## Part B
When we are talking about things, we use **that** or **which** (not who) in a relative clause

In these examples **that** is more usual than **which**, but sometimes you must use **which**. See Unit 95

## Part C
In relative clauses we use **who/that/which**, not **he/she/they/it**

## Part D
**What** = the thing(s) that

Compare **what** and **that**:
- **What happened** was my fault. (= the things that happened)

but
- Everything **that happened** was my fault.(not Everything what happened)
- The machine **that broke down** is now working again. (not The machine what broke down)
