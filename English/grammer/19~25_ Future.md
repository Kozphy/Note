###### tags: `engilsh grammerly intermediate`


## unit 19 Present tenses (I am doing/ I do) for the future
The persent continuous is more natual when we talk about arrangements.

### situation
This is Ben's diary for next week.

He **is playing** tennis on Monday afternoon.
He **is going** to the dentist on Tuesday morning.
He **is having** dinner with Kate on Firday.

In all these examples, ben has already decided and arranged to do these things.

### I'm doing something (tomorrow) = I have already decided and arranged to do it
- A: What **are** you **doing** on Saturday evening? B: I'**m going** to the theatre.
- A: What time **is** Katherine **arriving** tomorrow? B: Half past ten. I'**m meeting** her at the station.
- I'**m not working** tomorrow, so we can go out somewhere.
- Steve **isn't playing** football next Saturday. He's hurt his leg.

### Do not use will to talk about what you have arranged to do
- What **are** you **doing** this evening?
- Alex **is getting** married next month.

### You can also use the present continuous for an action just before you begin to do it. This happens especially with verbs of movement (go/come/leave etc.)
- I'm tired. I'**m going** to bed now. Goodnight.
- Jess, are you ready yet? Yes, I'**m coming**.

### Present simple (I do) with a future meaning
We use the present simple when we talk about timetables, programmes, etc. (for public transport, cinemas etc.)
- My train **leaves** at 11.30, so I need to be at the station by 11.15.
- What time **does** the film **start** this evening?
- It'**s** Wednesday tomorrow./ Tomorrow **is** Wednesday.

You can use the present simple to talk about people if their plans are fixed like a timetable
- I **start** my new job on Monday.
- What time **do** you **finish** work tomorrow?

## unit 20 (I'm) going to (do)
### I am going to do something = I have already decided to do it, I intend to do it
- **Are** you **going to eat** anything? No, I'm not hungry.
- A: I hear Sarah has won some money. What **is** she **going to do** with it? B: She'**s going to buy** a new car.
- I'**m** just **going to make** a quick phone call. Can you wait for me?
- This cheese smells horrible. I'**m not going to eat** it.

### I am doing and I am going to do
We use **I am doing** when we say what we have arranged to do
- What time **are** you **meeting** An this evening?
- I'**m leaving** tomorrow. I've got my plane ticket.

I **am going to do** something = I've decided to do it (but perhaps not arranged to do it)
- Your shoes are dirty. Yes, I know. I'**m going to clean** them. (= I've decided to clear them, but I haven't arranged to clean them)
- I've decided not to stay here any longer. Tomorrow I'**m going to look** for somewhere else to stay.

### You can also say that "something is going to happen" in the furture
#### situation
The man isn't lokking where he is going.

He **is going to walk** into the wall.

When we say that "something **is going to happen**", the situation now makes this clear. The man is walking towards the wall now, so we can see that he **is going walk** into it.

- Look at those black clouds! it'**s going to rain**.
- I feel terrible. I think I'**m going to be** sick.
- The economic situation is bad now and things **are going to get** worse.

### I was going to do something = I intended to do it, but didn't do it
- We **were going to travel** by train, but then we decided to go by car instead.
- Peter **was going to do** the exam, but he changed his mind.
- I **was** just **going to cross** the road when somebody shouted "Stop!"

### You can say that "something was going to happen" (but didn't happen)
- I thought it **was going to rain**, but it didn't.

## unit 21 Will / shall 1
### We use I'll(= I will) when we've just decided to do something. When we say "I'll do something" we announce our decision
- Oh, I've left the door open. I'**ll go** and shut it.
- What would you like to drink? I**ll have** an prange juice, please.
- Did you phone Lucy? Oh no, I forgot. I'**ll phone** her now.

### We often use I think I'll ... and I don't think I'll ...
- I feel a bit hungry. I **think I'll have** something to eat.
- I **don't think I'll go** out tonight. I'm too tired.

### In spoken English the negative of will is usually won't (= will not)
- I can see you're busy, so I **won't stay** long.

### Do not use will to talk about what you decided before (see Unit 19-20)
- I'**m going** on holiday next Saturday.
- **Are** you **working** tomorrow

### We often use will in these situations
Offering to do something
- That bag looks heavy. I'**ll help** you with it.

Agreeing to do something
- A: Can you give Tim this book? B: Sure, I'**ll give** it to him this afternoon.

Promising to do something
- Thanks for lending me the money. I'll pay you back on Friday.
- I won't tell anyone what happened. I promise.

Asking somebody to do something (Will you...?)
- I've tried to give her advice, but she **won't listen**.
- The car **won't start**. (= the car refuses to start)

### Shall I...? Shall we...?
Shall is used mostly in the questions **shall I...? / shall we...?**
We use **shall I...? / shall we...?** to ask somebody's opinion (expecially in offers or suggestions)
- **Shall I** open the window? (= Do you want me to open the window?)
- I've got no money. What **shall I** do? (= What do you suggest)
- **Shall we** go? Just a minute. I'm not ready yet.
- Where **shall we** have lunch? Let's go to Marino's.

Compare shall I...? and will you...?
- **Shall I** shut the door? (= Do you want me to shut it?)
- **Will you** shut the door? (= I want you to shut it)

## Unit 22 Will / shall 2
### part 1
We do not use **will** to say what somebody has already arranged or decided to do:
- Diane **is working** next week. (not Diane will work)
- **Are** you **going to watch** anything on TV this evening? (not Will you watch)

But often, when we talk about the future, we are not talking about somebody has decided to do. For example
- Charis: Do you think Kate **will pass** the exam. Joy: Yes, she'll pass easily. (She'll pass does not mean 'she has decided to pass.' )

Joy is saying what he knows or believes will happen. 
He is predicting the future.
When we predict a future happening or situation, we use **will/won't**.

### part 2 We often use will with
- probably: I'll probably be home late tonight.
- (I'm) sure: Don't worry about the exam. I'm sure you'll pass.
- (I) think: Do you think Sarah will like the present we bought her?
- (I) don't think: I don't think the exam will be very difficult.
- I wonder: I wonder what will happen.

After I **hope**, we generally use the present (will also possible)
- I hope Kate passes the exam. (or I hope Kate will pass...)
- I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow.

### part 3 Generally we use will to talk about the future, but sometimes we use will to talk about now.
- Don't phone Ann now. She'll be busy.

### part 4
I shall .../ we shall...
Normally we use **shall** only with **I** and **we**

## Unit 23 I will and I'm going to
### Study the difference will and (be) going to
will: We use **will** to announce a new decision.
- Let's have a party. That's a great idea. We'**ll invite** lots of people.

(be) going to: We use **(be) going to** when we have already decided to do something.
- Sarah and I have decided to have a party. We'**re going to invite** lots of people.

Compre
- Gary phoned while you were out. Ok. I'**ll call** him back.
- Gary phoned while you were out. Yes, I know. I'**m going to call** him back.

### Future happenings and situations (predicting the future)
We use both **will** and **going to** to predict future happenings and situations.

When we say something **is going to** happen, we know this from the situation now. What is happening now shows that something **is going to** happen in the future. For example:
- Look at those black clouds. It'**s going to rain**.
- I feel terrible. I think **I'm going to be** sick.

## Unit 24 Will be doing and will have done
### part 1 situation
Those people are standing in a queue to get into the cinema.

Half an hour from now, the cinema will be full. Everyone **will be watching** the film.

Three hours from now, the cinema will be empty.
The film **will have finished**
Everyone **will have gone** home.

### Part 2
I **will be doing** something (future continuous) = I will be in the middle of doing it:
- This time net week I'll be on holiday. I'**ll be lying** on the beach or **swimming** in the sea.
- You have no chance of getting the job. You'**ll be wasting** your time if you apply for it.

Compare **will be (do)ing** and **will**(do):
- Don't phone between 7 and 8. We'**ll be having** dinner.
- Let's wait for Liz to arrive and then we'**ll have** dinner.

Compare **will be -ing** with other continuous forms:
- At 10 o'clock yesterday, Sally **was** in her office. She **was working**. (past)
- It's 10 o'clock now. She **is** in her office. She **is working** (present)
- At 10 o'clock tomorrow, she **will be** in her office. She **will be working.**

### Part 3 
We also use **will be -ing** to talk about complete actions in the future. For example:
- The government **will be making** a statement about the crisis later today.
- **Will** you be going away this summer?
- Later in the programme, I'**ll be talking** to the Minister of Education.

In these examples **will be -ing** is similar to (be) going to...

### Part 4
We use **will have (done)**(future perfect) to say that something will already be complete before a time in the future.
- Sally always leaves for work at 8.30 in the morning. She son't be at home at 9 o'clock - she'**ll have gone** to work.
- We're late. The film **will** already **have started** by the time we get to the cinema.

Compare **will have (done)** with other perfect forms:
- Ted and Amy **have been** married for 24 years.
- Next year they **will have been** married for 25 years.
- When their son was born, they **had been** married for three years.

## Unit 25 When I do / When I've done, When and if
### part 1 situation
- Will you phone me tomorrow? Yes, I'll phone you **when I get** homr from work.

I'll phone you when I get home is a sentence with two parts:
the main part: I'**ll** phone you
the when part: **when** I **get** home

The time in the sentence is future (tomorrow), but we use a present tense (I **get**) in the **when**-part of the sentence.

We do not use **will** in the **when**-part of the sentence.

More example:
- We'**ll go** out **when** it stops raining. 
- **When** you **are** in London again, come and see us.
- What do you want to be **when** you **gow** up?

The same thing happens after **while / before / after / as soon as / until or till**:
- What are you going to do **while** I'**m** away?
- I'll probably go back home on Sunday. **Before** I **go**, I'd like to visit the museum.
- Wait here **until (or till)** I **come** back.

### part 2
You can also use the present perfect (**have done**) after **when / after / until / as soon as**:
- Can I borrow that book **when** you'**ve finished** with it?
- Don't say anything while lan is here. Wait **until** he **has gone**.

If you use the present perfect, one thing must be complete before the other (so the two things do not happen together):
- **When** I'**ve phoned** Kate, we can have dinner. (= First I'll phone Kate and after that we can have dinner.)

Do not use the present perfect if the two things happen together:
- **When** I **phone** Kate, I'll ask her about the party.

It is often possible to use either the present simple or the present perfect:
- I'll come **as soon as I finish**. or I'll come **as soon as I've finished**.
- You'll feel better **after you have** something to eat. or You'll feel better **after you've had** something to eat.

### part 3
After if, we normally use the present simple (if I do/ if I see etc.) for the future:
- It's raining hard. We'll get wet **if** we **go** out.
- I'll be angry **if** it **happens** again.
- Hurry up! **If** we **don't hurry**, we'll be late.

### part 4
When and if

We use **when** for things which are sure to happen:
- I'm going out later. (for sure) **When** I go out, I'll get some bread.

We use **if** for things that will possibly happen:
- I might go out later. **If** I go out, I'll get some bread.
