## The Eisenhower Box: How to be More Productive
1. Urgent and important (tasks you will do immediately).
2. Important, but not urgent (tasks you will schedule to do later).
3. Urgent, but not important (tasks you will delegate to someone else).
4. Neither urgent nor important (tasks that you will eliminate).

## The Difference Between Urgent and Important
> What is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important.  -Dwight Eisenhower
###  Urgent tasks
 The things that you feel like you need to react to: emails, phone calls, texts, news stories. 

### Important tasks
“The things that contribute to our `long-term mission, values, and goals.`”

## Elimination Before Optimization
