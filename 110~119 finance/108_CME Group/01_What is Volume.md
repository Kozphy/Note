Volume is a metric that is reported for all Futures Contracts.

It's calculated by counting the number of contracts that have been bought and sold over a given time.

## Volume may indicate
1. Price levels where traders are interested
2. Indicate traders rolling over to new month
3. Identify most liquid times of the day

When volume changes as the price of Futures Contract moves towards certain levels, this can indicate to a trader that a `change in direction may occur`.
