## Role of Broker
A **broker** is an individual or firm that **acts as an intermediary** between an investor and a **securities exchange**.

## Services Provided by Brokers
- **Execution of Orders**: Brokers execute buy and sell orders submitted by investors. They ensure that the transactions are carried out efficiently.
- **Compensation**: Brokers are compensated in various ways:
    - **Commissions**: Some brokers charge a commission (a fee) for their services.
    - **Fees**: Others may charge fees for specific services.
    - **Paid by Exchange**: In some cases, brokers are paid directly by the exchange itself.
## Types of Brokers
- **Discount Brokers**: These brokers execute trades on behalf of clients but typically **don’t provide investment advice**. They charge reduced commissions (usually in the range of $5 to $15 per trade) and often offer online trading platforms.
- **Full-Service Brokers**: These brokers provide a broader range of services, including `market research`, `investment advice`, and `retirement planning`. However, their commissions are higher due to the personalized advice they offer.
