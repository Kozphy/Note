## PE ratio
- **Definition**: The P/E ratio measures the **proportion of a company’s share price to its earnings per share (EPS)**. In other words, it tells us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings generated by the company.


$$
[ P/E = \frac{{\text{{Stock Price}}}}{{\text{{Earnings per Share (EPS)}}}} ]
$$
- **Stock Price** represents the current market price of one share of the company’s stock.
- **EPS** is the company’s earnings per share, which is typically calculated as net income divided by the number of outstanding shares.
- `outstanding shares`: Outstanding shares are all the shares issued and sold by a company that are not held by the company itself.

## EPS
- **Definition**: EPS represents how much money a company makes for each share of its stock. It’s calculated by dividing the company’s **net income** (`after subtracting preferred dividends`) by the **average number of common shares outstanding**.
$$
 [ \text{{EPS}} = \frac{{\text{{Net Income}}}}{{\text{{Outstanding Shares}}}}]

- **Determine Net Income**: Obtain the `net income` of the company.
- **Find Outstanding Shares**: Determine the total number of outstanding shares of the company’s stock.
