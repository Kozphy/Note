The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority `(IANA)` is the international body `responsible for assigning names for protocols` used on the Internet. Use these links to find out more about the names.

- `IANA media types` are `names` for the `types of data` that are commonly transmitted over the Internet. They are described at [here](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)
`Text media types` (such as a type that `begins with text/`, `or` a type that `contains +xml`) are identified by RFC 3023, which is available at [here](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3023.txt).

- `IANA character sets` are the `names of character set registries`. They are described at [here](https://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml).
