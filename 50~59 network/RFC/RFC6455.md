## Abstract

The WebSocket Protocol `enables two-way communication between a client
running untrusted code in a controlled environment to a remote host
that has opted-in to communications from that code`.

The security model used for this is the origin-based security model commonly used by web browsers.`The protocol consists of an opening handshake followed by basic message framing, layered over TCP`.

The `goal of this technology` is to provide a mechanism for browser-based applications that need two-way communication with servers that does not rely on opening multiple HTTP connections (e.g., using XMLHttpRequest or iframes and long polling).

## 1. Introduce

### 1.2 Protocol Overview

The protocol has two parts: a `handshake` and the `data transfer`.

The handshake `from the client` looks as follows:

        GET /chat HTTP/1.1
        Host: server.example.com
        Upgrade: websocket
        Connection: Upgrade
        Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
        Origin: http://example.com
        Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat
        Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13

   The handshake `from the server` looks as follows:

        HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
        Upgrade: websocket
        Connection: Upgrade
        Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=
        Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat

The `leading line from the client` follows the `Request-Line format`. The `leading line from the server` follows the `Status-Line format`.  The Request-Line and Status-Line productions are defined in [RFC2616].

An unordered set of `header fields` comes after the leading line in both cases.  The `meaning of these header fields` is specified [in Section 4](#4-opening-handshake) of this document.  Additional header fields may also be present, such as cookies [RFC6265](RFC6265.md).

Once the client and server have both sent their handshakes, and `if
the handshake was successful, then the data transfer part starts`.

This is a two-way communication channel where each side can, independently from the other, send data at will.

After a successful handshake, clients and servers transfer data back and forth in `conceptual units` referred to in this specification as `"messages"`.

On the wire, `a message is composed of one or more frames`. The WebSocket message does not necessarily correspond to a particular network layer framing, as a fragmented message may be coalesced or split by an intermediary.

### 1.3 Opening Handshake

The `opening handshake is intended` to be `compatible with HTTP-based
server-side` software and `intermediaries`, so that a single port can be used by both HTTP clients talking to that server and WebSocket clients talking to that server.  `To this end, the WebSocket client's handshake is an HTTP Upgrade request`:

        GET /chat HTTP/1.1
                Host: server.example.com
                Upgrade: websocket
                Connection: Upgrade
                Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
                Origin: http://example.com
                Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat
                Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13

`header fields` in the `handshake` may be `sent by the client in any order`, so the `order` in which different header fields are received is `not significant`.

The `"Request-URI" of the GET` method [RFC2616] is used to `identify the endpoint` of the WebSocket connection, both to allow multiple domains to be served from one IP address and to allow multiple WebSocket endpoints to be served by a single server.

## 4. Opening Handshake

## 5. Data Framing

### 5.1 Overview

`In the WebSocket Protocol, data is transmitted using a sequence of
frames`.

To avoid confusing network intermediaries (such as intercepting proxies) and for security reasons that are further discussed in [Section 10.3](#103-attacks-on-infrastructure-masking), `a client MUST mask all frames that it sends to the server` (see [Section 5.3](#53-client-to-server-masking) for further details). (Note that masking is done whether or not the WebSocket Protocol is running over TLS.) The `server MUST close the connection upon receiving a frame that is not masked`. In this case, a server MAY send a Close frame with a status code of 1002 (protocol error) as defined in [Section 7.4.1](#741-defined-status-codes). `A server MUST NOT mask any frames that it sends to the client.` `A client MUST close a connection if it detects a masked frame`. In this case, it MAY use the status code 1002 (protocol error) as defined in [Section 7.4.1](#741-defined-status-codes). (These rules might be relaxed in a future specification.)

The `base framing protocol` defines a **frame type with an [opcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opcode)**, **a payload length**, and **designated locations for "Extension data" and "Application data"**, which together `define the "Payload data"`. Certain bits and opcodes are reserved for future expansion of the protocol.

A `data frame MAY be transmitted by either the client or the server` at any time `after opening handshake completion` and `before that endpoint has sent a Close frame` ([Section 5.5.1](#551-close)).

### 5.2 Base Framing Protocol

This wire format for the data transfer part is described by the ABNF [RFC5234](RFC5234.md) given in detail in this section. (Note that, unlike in other sections of this document, `the ABNF in this section is operating on groups of bits`. The length of each group of bits is indicated in a comment.  `When encoded on the wire, the most significant bit is the leftmost in the ABNF)`. A `high-level overview of the framing is given in the following figure`.  `In a case of conflict between` the `figure` below and the `ABNF specified` later in this section, the `figure` is `authoritative`.
