## Abstract

`This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields`. These header fields can be `used by HTTP servers to store state (called cookies) at HTTP user agents`, letting the servers maintain a stateful session over the mostly stateless HTTP protocol.  `Although cookies have many historical infelicities that degrade their security and privacy`, the Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields are `widely used on the Internet`.
