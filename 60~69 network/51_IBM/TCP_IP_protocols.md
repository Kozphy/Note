## TCP/IP protocols
TCP/IP is a family of communication protocols used to connect computer systems in a network. It is named after two of the protocols in the family: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP). Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a member of the TCP/IP family.

## IP
IP is a ðŸ‘‰`network-layer` protocol that provides a connectionless data transmission service that is used by TCP. Data is transmitted link by link; an end-to-end connection is never set up during the call. The unit of data transmission is the **datagram**.

## TCP
TCP is a ðŸ‘‰`transport-layer` protocol that provides a reliable, full duplex, connection-oriented data transmission service.

## HTTP
HTTP is an :point_right:`application-layer` protocol that is used for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the protocol used between web clients and web servers.
