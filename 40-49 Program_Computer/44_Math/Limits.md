## intro

Sometimes we **can't work something out directly** ... but we can see what it should **be as we get closer and closer**!

$$
\frac{(x^2 -1)}{(x-1)}
$$

if we caculate with `x = 1`

$$
\frac{(1^2-1)}{(1-1)} = \frac{(1-1)}{(1-1)} = \frac{0}{0}
$$

We don't really know the value of $\frac{0}{0}$ (It is "indeterminate").

So we need to use another way to **approach** it **closer and closer**:

We want to give the answer "2" but can't, so instead mathematicians say exactly what is going on by using the special word "limit".

The **limit** of  $\frac{(x^2−1)}{(x−1)}$ as x approaches 1 is **2**

which can write as symbols is:
$$
\lim_{x \to 1}\frac{x^2-1}{x-1} = 2
$$
