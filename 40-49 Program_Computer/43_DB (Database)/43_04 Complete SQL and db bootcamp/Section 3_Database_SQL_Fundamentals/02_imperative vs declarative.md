## declarative language (what will happen?) -> 
You're going to get feedback from users, but we have no idea how that's going to happen.

## Imperative programming (how it will happen?) -> more flexibility but more complex
Imperative programming is where you go line by line by line, saying do this, do that, do that, go read from over there in declarative.
