[What Is the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and How Does It Work? | Synopsys](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-sdlc.html#:~:text=Definition,the%20shortest%20possible%20production%20time.)
## SDLC (Software development lifecycle)
- Phase 1
	- System Planning and Selection
- Phase 2
	- System Analysis 
		- Do we need database?
		- mobile applications?
		- teams?
		- allocation?
- Phase 3
	- System Design
		- architecture diagrams
		- database design -> entities, what kind of table column do we need?
- Phase 4
	-  System implementation and Operation

## The goal of system
- low coupling
	-  **Coupling** refers to the degree of **interdependence** between software modules.
- high cohesion
	- **Cohesion** refers to the degree to which elements within a module work together to fulfill a **single, well-defined purpose**.

> Low coupling and high cohesion make a system **easier to maintain and improve**.

## The process can be implemented
- agile
	- you pivot, you try to move rapidly, you adjust as you go
- waterfall
	- It's a regimented process for industries that are heavily, heavily, heavily regulated.
- v-model
	- In hardware, you have very slow life cycles.
