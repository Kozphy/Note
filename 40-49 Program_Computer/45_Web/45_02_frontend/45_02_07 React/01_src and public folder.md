##  **`src` (Source) Folder**:
- The **`src`** folder contains the **source code** for your React application. It’s where you organize and write your JavaScript, CSS, and other assets.
- Within this folder, you’ll find files that contribute to the functionality and appearance of your app. These files are typically unminified and meant for development.
- Key components within the **`src`** folder include:
	- **`index.js`**: This file serves as the **JavaScript entry point** for your application.
	- Other JavaScript files, React components, stylesheets, and assets specific to your project.
## **`public` Folder**:
- The **`public`** folder is where you place files that need to be **publicly accessible** from the web. These files are directly served to users.
- Contents within the **`public`** folder are not processed by build tools. They are simply copied as-is to the build output.
- Common files placed in the **`public`** folder include:
	- **`index.html`**: This is the **page template** for your app. It serves as the starting point when a user visits your site.
	- **Images**, **fonts**, and other static files that should be accessible directly via URLs.
