## Statement
A statement is a `basic unit` of execution of a program. A program consists of multiple statements.
```csharp
int age = 21;
int marks = 90;
```
### In C# we have two different type of statement
#### Declaration Statement
- Declaration statements are used to declare and initialize variables.
```csharp
char ch;
int maxValue = 55;
```
#### Expression statement
- An expression followed by a semicolon is called an expression statement.
```csharp
area = 3.14 * redius * radius;
```
## Expression (variable, literals, method calls and operators)
- Â Expressions can be assigned or used as operands.
-  An expression is anything that yields a value and can be used in places where a value is expected.
- an expression must have at least one operand but may not have any operator.
```csharp
double temperature;
temperature = 42.05;
```
