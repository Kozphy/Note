## What is meta programming
**Metaprogramming**Â is a fascinating technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat other programs as their data

`Read`: Understand and analyze other programs.
`Generate`: Create new code dynamically.
`Analyze`: Examine and manipulate existing code.
`Transform`: Modify or adapt other programs.
`Modify itself while running`: Yes, you read that right! A program can even change its own behavior during execution.
