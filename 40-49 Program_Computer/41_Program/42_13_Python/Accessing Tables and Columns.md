# Accessing Tables and Columns
###### tags: `database learn`

The `MetaData` object contains all of the schema constructs weâ€™ve associated with it.

It supports a few methods of accessing these table objects, such as the `sorted_tables` accessor which returns a list of each `Table` object in order of foreign key dependency (that is, each table is preceded by all tables which it references):

```python=
for t in metadata_obj.sorted_tables:
   print(t.name)
```

Once a Table has been defined, it has a full set of accessors which allow inspection of its properties. 
```python=
employees = Table('employees', metadata_obj,
    Column('employee_id', Integer, primary_key=True),
    Column('employee_name', String(60), nullable=False),
    Column('employee_dept', Integer, ForeignKey("departments.department_id"))
)

# access the column "employee_id":
employees.columns.employee_id

# or just
employees.c.employee_id

# via string
employees.c['employee_id']

# iterate through all columns
for c in employees.c:
    print(c)

# get the table's primary key columns
for primary_key in employees.primary_key:
    print(primary_key)

# get the table's foreign key objects:
for fkey in employees.foreign_keys:
    print(fkey)

# access the table's MetaData:
employees.metadata

# access the table's bound Engine or Connection, if its MetaData is bound:
employees.bind

# access a column's name, type, nullable, primary key, foreign key
employees.c.employee_id.name
employees.c.employee_id.type
employees.c.employee_id.nullable
employees.c.employee_id.primary_key
employees.c.employee_dept.foreign_keys

# get the "key" of a column, which defaults to its name, but can
# be any user-defined string:
employees.c.employee_name.key

# access a column's table:
employees.c.employee_id.table is employees

# get the table related by a foreign key
list(employees.c.employee_dept.foreign_keys)[0].column.table
```
