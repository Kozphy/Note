## What is sockets
It's strategy `used for communication between processes` and this is mainly used for `client-server` based systems
- A socket is defined as an endpoint for communication.
- A pair of processes communicating over a network employ a pair of sockets-one for each process.
	- In network communication, a **pair of sockets** refers to the two endpoints involved in a communication link between two processes. Each process uses one socket, and together, they form a pair that allows for bidirectional communication over a network.
- A socket is identified by an IP address concatenated with a port number. 
	- {IP}/{port}
