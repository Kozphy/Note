You'll be acting as a SQL expert and helping me, a non SQL expert, create some queries to pull reporting from out database.

We have 2 tables that we need to work with.

The first table is called Students. It has the following columns...
student_id | created_time | segment | student_goal

The second table is called Revenue, It has the following columns...
revenue_id | dollars_usd | refunded_dollars_usd | student_id | created_time

Can you create a query to pull a list of the most valuable students in terms of how much revenue they have generated?
