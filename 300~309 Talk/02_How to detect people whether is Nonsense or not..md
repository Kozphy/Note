Detecting whether someone is **spouting nonsense** is an important skill. 

In a commencement address by the president of Harvard University, she emphasized the significance of cultivating this ability. 

Let’s explore how to differentiate between `truth and falsehood`:
### **Hierarchy of Evidence**
Use the `“Hierarchy of Evidence”` method to assess the reliability of information. This theory categorizes evidence into different levels, from least credible to most credible:
#### **Base Level**
Individual anecdotes, personal stories, and expert opinions.
#### **Intermediate Level**
Uncontrolled observational experiments.
#### **High Level**
Controlled scientific experiments, large-scale, long-term studies, and meta-analyses.

### **Scientific Method**
Apply logical and thoughtful scientific methods to evaluate truth. Avoid relying solely on individual stories or personal opinions.
    
### **Source Reliability**
Seek comprehensive, authoritative analyses from reputable academic organizations.

## Summary
In summary, maintain an open mindset, continuously pursue truth, and use rational methods to assess information credibility. Remember that even well-intentioned individuals can inadvertently spread misinformation. [Keep learning and adapting as new evidence emerges](https://soundshine.com.tw/article2020031/)
